# PART 13: PROPOSALS

# 13.1 Overview

In this book we have compared the Tax and Welfare system to an operating system; a mechanism of levers through which society is run, funds are raised, and public services are delivered. Using this metaphor, we have been able to troubleshoot the bugs in the current system and illustrate why the UK has seen increasing inequality of outcomes for the best and the worst off in our society. 

We have an unwieldy, overly complex tax and welfare system in which the rich get richer, while those on the bottom see their income and wealth stagnate. By delivering benefits on a means-tested basis, our benefit system doesn't encourage re-entering employment.

Early on in this book we outlined the framework we choose to structure the evaluation of the UK tax system, by building on Beveridge's work in fighting his five great evils of society. These guiding principles structure our analysis. We argue for a tax system that is fair, and lead to greater equality of opportunity amongst its members. It should be beneficial and contribute to the sustainable and ethical development of a society. Finally such a system should be practical in its administration and application. 

Taxes, amongst their other roles of nudging incentives and redistributing income, are predominately aimed at financing public provision of goods and services - including welfare for the most needy in society. Therefore, we emphasise that these three balls need to be balanced carefully so as to ensure that the UK's Tax and Welfare system helps us build the society that we aim to achieve.

Discussed extensively in the book, it's important to summarise the findings from our discussion. These are expanded upon below. Broadly, on the whole, we plan to simplify the income tax and benefit system, and augment taxes where there is a social outcome that needs to be achieved through discouraging negative behaviour. A comprehensive Land Value Tax (LVT) would be phased in, so as to ensure that land was successfully developed, and any excess rent could be captured and that windfall redistributed.

Our proposals below should be considered interim, since we have not yet completed accurate modelling of all their effects.

# 13.2 The Mirrlees Review

Our starting point in building our proposals were the recommendations of the Mirrlees review [@Mirrlees2010]. This document suggested a number of key reforms of the UK tax system, so as to create effective incentives for a better functioning society. It also discussed different approaches to the taxation of income invested, with particular reference to whether whether gains or the final consumption are taxed. The review does not cover the benefit system. The recommendations of the summary reportare as follows:

1. Replace Business Rates with a Land Value Tax
2. Reform Council tax (and transactions) into a single simple tax on property.
3. Remove exemptions from VAT and refund by increases in benefits and allowances
4. Introduce congestion charging
5. Rationalise the approach to greenhouse gas (carbon) taxation
6. Remove transaction taxes (stamp duties) as highly economically distorting.
7. Introduce a consistent approach for dealing with the VAT exception of financial services (especially when bundled with other services)
8. Simplify where possible.
9. Introduce an allowance for corporate equity (ACE) to eliminate the favouring of debt financing over equity.

We use these proposals to guide our own recommendations for new policies. 

# 13.3 Philosophy of Our Proposals

In this section we explain the guiding philosophy behind our proposals, and define a simple set of proposals that may help achieve an ideal taxation system. The guiding principles here are that the system will be beneficial, fair, and practical.

## Beneficiaries

Our new tax system considers the citizens of the UK to be akin to the 'shareholders' of a company, with a stake in the outcome of the country. These citizens are therefore the intended beneficiaries of the tax system. The 'paying customers' of this system should be the property owners, particularly the owners of UK land and anyone profiting from, or otherwise building wealth by selling goods and services to, UK consumers. This also should apply to those individuals/organisations which are otherwise receiving payments from the UK. The tax system should charge them for this benefit received.

## Changing Incentives

Income, Wealth and Environmental Damage of Consumption should be taxed. Personal Incomes are already adequately taxed, while Wealth and Environmental Damages are not. The main goal of our wealth taxation proposals is to tax the top 1% (and particularly the top 0.1%) by wealth. This can be achieved by taxing all forms of wealth, with allowances/subsidies granted to those who remain resident in the UK. We also propose to properly regulate environmental damage through the application of a Carbon tax, which should help incentivise more sustainable consumer behaviour. 

## Avoiding Avoidance

Under the new system, you would receive *tax benefits* from residing in the UK. Land is an inelastic base of taxation, as it is unable to be moved, and alongside the profits from consumption by UK customers. Non resident foreigners who own UK assets will be treated in an equivalent way to the UK super rich - with high levels of taxation applied to their UK holdings. 

## Simplicity is key

The tax system should be as simple as possible. Thus we simplify wherever possible. Moreover, where and if there are options for making the tax system automatic, we should take them. This system should not need or involve any 'self assessment', which can often act as an extra barrier to engaging fully with the system.

## Privacy and Transparency

The new tax system should have privacy for ordinary members of the public. That could be achieved by the assignment of secure identities to taxpayers which are independent of their real identity (so that name or address would be separately stored than the 'tax' identity). This would ensure the safety of the citizens of the UK. There may however be a case made for the complete transparency of the very rich (0.1% by wealth or income) and major companies. This would be part of a check-and-balance mechanism is in place to regulate political and financial influence within the UK.

# 13.4 Institutional Reforms

## Residency Allowance

As mentioned above, the new tax system would shift incentives to ensure that there were strong tax benefits to maintaining UK residency (i.e. a residency allowance). This would replace tax benefits for offshore or non-dom status. The super rich and the offshore resident owners would therefore be treated equivalently, with steep tax rates,  unless the offshore residents reside in a trusted partner country with good disclosure mechanisms on taxable assets (e.g. an EU country).

## Local Taxation

Taxes on housing should be transformed over time into a 100% Land Value Tax, plus a wealth allowance. The exact size of this wealth allowance could be decided by local authorities. Local authorities would therefore be funded by a progressive land wealth tax. Any uplift in land rental values should be distributed 50-50 between local authorities and national authorities. This LVT could be adjusted for the effect of any infrastructure investments on land values, where 100% of the uplift would be captured by the authority making the investment. 

## Strategic Tax Reform

Instead of having an annual budget, the tax system should be treated strategically. In other words, it would be run much like the strategic spending and defence review - namely a 'strategic tax review'.

# 13.5 Transitional Questions

To ensure that these new proposals are implemented successfully, any transition to the new taxation system would need to to account for the following three effects. 

1) First the transition must be *practical* and *simple* to understand.
2) Second the transition should be, and be seen to be, *fair*.
3) Third the transition should be seen to be *beneficial* in the short term as well as the long term.

Asset value effects are important in this. These are important both from the fairness persective and from the perspective of economic benefit. Volatile rises and falls in asset values are arguably unfair -rises because the people who receive these rises are not necessarily deserving of it; and likewise for any falls. Both of these impacts can be amplificed through ineffective application of government policy. For example, two major government policies -not revaluing Council tax and reductions in long term interest rates - have caused national house price increases.

# 13.6 Options for Taxes on Personal Income

Income Tax and National Insurance together account for around half of all revenue raised. These taxes are likely to be important for the foreseeable future. Income tax is important as a tax on wage income and on income from investments.  It is also the primary means of affecting the distribution of income using the tax system. However the existing approach is, like the rest of the tax system, unnecessary complex. Income tax, and its close cousin National Insurance (which we combine into a single tax) are also extremely efficient ways of raising revenue.

At present, the wage income is largely deducted at source in the 'Pay as You Earn' (PAYE) system. This means that companies administer the payment of income tax. They know how much tax to deduct because every individual has a tax code. The tax code indicates whether the taxpayer pays basic or higher rate tax. 

Some income does not fall under PAYE for example: dividend income. It is impractical for a company to know all the tax codes of its shareholders. Thus, income from dividends needs to be declared by individuals at the end of the tax year alongside income tax paid by the individual concerned. At present, corporation tax is paid on profits, and the income tax paid on dividend income is reduced by an equivalent amount to compensate. 

## Simplification Options

We can distinguish between tax simplification and the addition of a basic income.

First, lets look at tax simplification. We can simplify the tax code through the following procedure. First put the income tax and NI system together for earned income, and apply the same rates to unearned income as earned income. Then, you would consider the top rates of tax (Income Tax + NI). We keep these as they are now, and then apply it to lower tax bands. At the same time increase the personal allowance. The two procedures can ensure that nobody pays more tax on their earned income than they do at present. 

- Option 1 is this zero-high rate system (ie a large personal allowance plus a top rate)
- Option 2 is the same system, but with a low rate (no personal allowance) plus a high rate. A small basic income can be added.
- Option 3 is a basic income plus the high rate flat tax

With a flat system, everyone faces the same tax rate. There is no need for a separate tax code for each individual. All income can thus be taxed at source. This would also brings the taxation of dividends into the income tax system, which would therefore mean there is no need for a corporation tax on the part of company profits hich is paid out as dividends. We still, however, need a tax on retained earnings.

The disadvantage of a flat tax system is that it is less progressive than the other system.

## Conclusions

We propose to combine the current National Insurance and Income Tax systems so that there is a single tax on income. We also propose to simplify the rate structure so that there is only one rate above the allowance. Having a single rate allows the tax system to be made considerably simpler, and permits taxes to be deducted at source.

# 13.7 Overview of Possibilities for Taxing Wealth 

## Source-based Private Wealth Taxes

In general, we prefer to recommend source-based wealth taxes rather than residence based taxes. In other words, we propose to tax income-generating assets located in the UK. The advantage of this approach is that these assets are typically less mobile than the individual. This reduces the risk of tax avoidance. However, there may be a case for an internationally coordinated residence tax as well. 

## Residence-based Private Wealth Taxes

Because of the source-based wealth taxes we have suggested above, such a tax would not need to be set as stringently. However, risk of avoidance by the rich may be high because of their access to skilled legal advice and mechanisms to move their assets to the most advantageous locations. It may therefore be necessary to impose an international residence-based wealth tax.

We propose to consult with European and other partners so as to put in place an internationally coordinated wealth tax. The objective would be to ensure that the richest in society do not get richer faster. As outlined in previous chapters, the increased rate of growth in wealth as compared to the growth in average incomes contributes to the compounding of inequality. For a variety of reasons, this is not a desirable outcome. To that end, we aim to form a coalition with other countries to promote transparency, and create a single coordinated residence wealth tax. However, getting international agreement consensus on such a policy would be difficult and time consuming, and so should not be relied upon.

## Conclusions

We will apply a source based approach which minimises the possibilities for avoidance, including a land value tax.

# 13.8 Taxes on Corporate Profit

We propose the reform of the corporation tax system. Our goal is a system of company taxation that rewards exporting companies and all those that invest in physical capital expenditure in the UK. We also want to find a solution that avoids the'race to the bottom' mentality of international corporate tax rates. Here, we suggest a reform of the VAT and existing corporation tax system that achieves just that. Our proposal here is to unify VAT and corporation tax under a company cash flow tax. 

A corporation tax is a tax on company profits. It generally covers both profits retained within the company (retained earnings) and those paid out as dividends (distributed earnings). A credit is applied to distributed earnings so tax is only paid once. But should we have a corporate tax at all? Since companies are owned by individuals, might it not be simpler to tax individuals rather than companies?  

What, in fact, is the purpose of the Corporation Tax system? It functions as an at-source tax on company profits made in the UK. It therefore has a few purposes:

- To tax foreigners on profits made in the UK and so mitigate the flow of wealth overseas from for example monopolies owned by foreign owners.
- To prevent companies being used as tax free savings devices.
- To ensure that companies pay a fair share of the cost for the government services provided to the company (eg. enforcement of property rights, education of the workforce, health care provision).

Some options for corporation tax then that ensure that these aims are upheld are listed as follows:

- Publicly quoted companies should have the option to pay the cash flow tax in shares. These shares would accrue to a sovereign wealth fund which would pay the Citizen's Dividend.
- A 'monopoly charge' of 5% of the company value (proportional to value added sold to UK consumers,i.e. like VAT) would be imposed on all large companies and on trusts. This tax would be payable in shares to a sovereign wealth fund for children, so that1/20th of the shares of a company or trust would go to such a fund per year.
- International wealth transparency tax of 0.1% of assets greater than 5 million pounds
- Capital Gains Tax: If the tax paid on retained earnings is less than the average tax paid on dividends, company owners will have an incentive to retain those earnings within the company. The owner of the shares could later sell them. They would therefore pay less tax than if the earnings had been paid out as dividends. Capital gains tax on
shares ownership can be thought of as a crude way to prevent tax avoidance through this route. Capital gains tax also allows those who have achieved unearned capital value increases (for example, due to the fall in long-term interest rates) to contribute properly. Capital gains tax rates should be set consistently to
avoid tax advantages or disadvantages based on legal structure. 
- Applying an Immigration and Citizenship charge

## Proposals 

We propose to replace Corporation Tax and VAT with a 'cash flow' tax and taxation at source of all dividends. Whereas a corporation tax is a tax on 'economic profit', a cash flow tax is a tax on net receipts (i.e. retained cash flow). Cash-flow is a destination basis corporate tax, exempting exporters, capital investment and R&D but including interest payments. The basis of the cash flow tax is UK sales and borrowing minus costs, dividends, interest and principal repayments. It therefore exempts capital expenditure and exports. It is similar to a value added tax, where wage expenditures are deductible. The advantage of the cash flow tax is that can be applied to the financial sector and it encourages investment and exporters. With corporation tax, companies can move the jurisdiction they are registered in, and charge losses to high-tax locations and profits to low tax locations. With a cash flow tax, all sales in the UK are taxed, and only UK wage payments are deductible. It applies to all companies that sell in the UK, and 'transfer pricing' becomes irrelevant. It avoids the international 'race to the bottom' among corporate tax rates.

## Radical Reform of the VAT and Corporation Tax system

Our objectives for reform of VAT and Corporation tax are as follows:
Help exporters
Help companies with large investment needs
Remove the tax advantage of debt over equity

In this section we keep our overall goal in mind -- to reform the tax system so that it rewards wealth creation in the UK (in particular capital formation and exports). We also want to find a solution that avoids the 'race to the bottom' of international corporate tax rates - that is good for the UK and yet does not lead to a sub-optimal Here we suggest a reform of the VAT and existing corporation tax system that does that. 
A corporation tax is a tax on company profits.What is the purpose of the Corporation Tax system? The Canadian Carter commission report argued that the purpose would be "(i) to be a backstop to the personal income tax, and (ii) to tax foreigners on their income earned in the domestic country (i.e. Canada). So corporate income is taxed first and then the tax paid is credited back when dividend payments are made.
Cash-flow, destination basis corporate tax, exempting exporters, capital investment and R and D but including interest payments.
Corporation Tax has problems. 
First we outline the approach to the two taxes at present.
It's purpose is to tax foreigners on cash earned in the UK; and perhaps to prevent various forms of tax arbitrage (for example keeping profits in the company). 
Our proposal here is to unify VAT and corporation tax under a company cashflow tax. This is similar to a VAT. It is described in detail by Auerbach (ref).
Under a cashflow tax, incoming payments are taxed (including domestic sales, wages, borrowing), and outgoing payments are refunded (including cost of sales, sub-contractors, wages, dividends, interest and principal repayments ). This is similar to a VAT, except that wages are deductible and debt is treated on a consistent basis to equity. Just like VAT, exports would not be taxable (we ignore EEA issues for now), and imports would be taxable. 
Moving to such a system has potential advantages. It would favour exporters and those willing to invest. Rather than the distinction between large and small companies, we would make the distinction between exporters in competitive markets and domestic producers which may or may not be competitive. If an exporter is earning large profits from exports, that is something to be celebrated and that money should be available for investment (and the investment should be tax deductible). 
Combining a cashflow tax with a source-based flat or single-rate tax (I define a 'single-rate' tax to be a flat tax with a personal allowance - a residency-based work based tax rebate), makes a lot of sense. A flat tax collected on a source basis can cover.
So one example set-up would be to combine a 40% single-rate tax with a 40% corporate tax (0% on exports and with investment deductible). VAT would be abolished. In this case, a domestic-sales company (including foreign-located and foreign-owned sellers in British markets) would pay 40% on retained earnings.
40% might sound a lot, but it's important to note that exporters pay nothing and there are much greater deduct-abilities than before -- and VAT is being combined with corporation tax here. Concerns
One concern is that VAT is required at a European level; however, since what we are doing is simply exempting income tax, the same result can be achieved by higher VAT and lower income tax - unfortunately the VAT rate would be VERY high (since VAT is charge additively, the equivalent additive rate for a 40% subtract is (0.6/0.4)-1, i.e. 50% (quite an increase on current VAT rates).
If such a tax were introduced, some account would need to be taken of domestic rents exported (e.g. foreigners buying fossil fuels or staying in hotels). A source based rent tax would be even more necessary.

Incidence of tax/





# 13.9 Taxes on Land and Property

Because land is fixed in supply, it can be taxed without causing significant economic distortion. A land tax subtracts the value of the premises from the tax on the land itself. It can be imposed progressively, reducing the return to landownership (capital gain plus rent) to around a zero nominal return.

The implementation of a land value tax can be achieved in two main ways. Firstly, a simple tax on land values and secondly, the public ownership of land combined with short-term lease sales. The successful city states of East Asia: Hong Kong and Singapore, adopt one of these two options. Hong Kong, due to the new territories being originally leased from China to Britain, never had private land ownership simply because the land was to be returned to China eventually. So the government of Hong Kong receives a large part of its revenue in the sale of leases of 20 or 30 years term. 

This tax is best introduced in 3 separate ways:

1. Implementation as a national replacement for as many existing taxes as possible (council tax, stamp duty land tax, inheritance tax on land, TV license fee, etc.).
2. Use of this tax as a macroeconomic stabilizer (the bank of England could increment this tax in order to avoid propose and to ensure that real terms house prices decline gradually to more reasonable levels).
3. Introduction of 'land value covenants', similar to 'government mortgages' but with the interest paid proportional to local land values. Those who have difficulty paying the tax(for example because they are asset rich or income poor) would have the option to roll up the tax into an indefinite 'interest payment' index to the value of the land.
4. Some time threshold for any residual freehold ownership (e.g. 99 years).

A land value tax on built up land would take the total value of the property and subtract the value of the building. Both values are easily assessed: for example there are multiple websites accessing overall property value. The advantage of subtracting property value is also that beautiful and historic buildings, and those that contribute to the character of areas can be recognize as such. This subsidy on building size would work well as a way to mitigate the increase of fossil fuel taxes on household energy bills.


# 13.10 Environmental, Fossil Fuel and Congestion Taxes

Some economic activity causes significant harm to people or the environment, for example:

- overfishing
- pollution (such as greenhouse emissions)
- congestion (caused by driving at rush-hour)
- smoking
- consumption of high levels of sugar or salt.

We propose to tax these abuses and behaviours. For example, we propose that a greenhouse gas  emissions tax should be imposed. Such a tax should avoid making industry in the UK uncompetitive so it should be taxed on a consumption basis (i.e. based only on UK sales, wherever they are produced). This tax can be implemented upstream on fossil fuel extraction and import and on embodied emissions in imports. It should refund taxes paid on exports. The refund for a good being exported and the tariff on the same good being imported need to be the same, to prevent import-export tax arbitrage. Other taxes should be imposed according to similar principles.

Moving specifically to fossil fuels, there are four main reasons for fuel taxes: 
1. Greenhouse Gas Emissions
2. Resource Rent
3 Costs of Roads, Airports and other Infrastructure
4. Congestion i.e. use of Road Space
5. Environmental and Health Damage
2-4 are dealt with under 'Environmental taxes'. We just consider resource rents here.

## 

So unlike in countries without resources where the incentives are to work hard and produce valuable products, in resource-rich countries, the incentives are to be powerful enough to control the resources. This is called the resource curse and we can see that those regions which contain great oil reserves also contain repressive regimes and political instability.Furthermore, high resource rents  involve a transfer of money from consuming to producing countries which is against the interest of the consuming countries. Therefore, it would be in consumers' interests to reduce the rent by limiting consumption of oil through taxes and other measures. 

Resource rent taxes can be charged both by consumers and by producers. In that way there is competition between the two. There is already a tax on profits from extraction of north sea oil and an aggregates levy. These should be retained.

There could also be a rents tax on oil imposed by coordinated internationally between oil-consuming countries. We propose an internationally-coordinated tax on oil consumption. This should be increased to reduce the open-market price of oil. Such a tax is essential to reduce new exploration and the environmental damage it may cause. It would also reduce trade deficits. Taxes on extraction of oil should be retained. In principle they should include extraction of any other high-rent natural resources, although oil appears to be the only relevant natural resource in the case of the UK. Such taxes should be coordinated between oil-consuming countries. Also, tackling climate change requires that fossil fuels are no longer extracted. In order for this to happen, the value of those fossil fuels on the open market needs to be low or zero. In other words, the rent needs to be captured by taxes in the consuming countries. A resource rent tax is, in effect, a land value taxon resource rents which would otherwise be captured overseas.  

## Land use and Maintenance Costs

Typically, roads are provided free at the point of use by the government for all car and other users to enjoy. In the UK, there's only one toll road (and a few toll bridges);all other costs are paid by the government. However, the revenue raised by fuel and vehicle taxes is more than a cost of roads so this taxes are revenue raising and behaviour changing more than just a cost of the infrastructure.

## Congestion Charges

Cars travelling at peak times take up limited road space and prevent other car users from reaching their destination in a timely fashion. Road fuel taxes can be seen as implicitly charging for congestion; however, they do so highly imperfectly (because congestion and its cost are concentrated very specific times and places which do not constitute a large proportion of the fuel use)and so we suggest a separate congestion charge. 

We propose to adjust the existing road tax to become a congestion charge. This would work on a tax and rebate system. Everyone would pay the charge but people would have the option to have a black box in their car which would prove through acceleration, location or time that the driver was not driving in a congested area. Every day that the vehicle was not in congestion would be refunded from the overall tax.

## Other Local Pollution Taxes

Burning fossil fuels causes both global and local environmental problems. In addition, burning oil products in cars causes health problems and car travel is relatively dangerous. A tax on fuel is a way of paying for those costs. 
Additional local pollution caused by coal, for example SO2, soot (including PM10s), needs to be controlled by taxes or tradable permits. 

## Carbon Tax

Carbon dioxide,methane, nitrous oxide, CFCs, SF6 and other gases cause global warming. Carbon dioxide also causes ocean acidification: the reduction in pH of the upper oceans. The likely magnitude and severity of these global effects is somewhat uncertain but likely to be severe in the long term. CO2 is produced on combustion of carbon-based fuels, such as fossil fuels (natural gas, petroleum and coal). 

We propose that carbon tax should replace existing taxes on fossil fuels (except road fuel duty). It should be implemented 'upstream' on imports and extraction of fossil fuel according to carbon content. Rather than a slow increase in carbon tax rates we suggest implementing revenue neutral reform that compensates losers. 

Summary of aspects of tax on greenhouse gas emissions: 

1. Tax upstream: tax precursors like fossil fuels as they enter the country
2. Tax base should be consumption,not production 

Upstream taxation is about the administration of the tax. Carbon is conserved so every molecule of CO2 relates to a single atom of carbon in the original fuel.Hence, a CO2 tax is also a carbon tax. CO2 can therefore be taxed on the carbon content of the original fuel. In general greenhouse should be taxed 'upstream' on relevant precursors if possible because it's usually simpler that way; and this is always the case with carbon/carbon dioxide.

Most proposals for carbon taxes focus on the production of greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions. However, if one taxes the production of GHG emissions, it will encourage industry to move to those locations which have low emissions taxes. We therefore propose to tax consumption instead, so the tax base would be all greenhouse gas emissions produced as a result of British consumers' activity. This tax base would then include products manufactured overseas and consumed by British citizens. Therefore, to implement an upstream carbon tax with a consumption base requires adjustments at borders. These adjustments need to tax imports and exempt exports from the carbon tax. 

There are two types of adjustments that could be made on imports. The first would neutralise the effect of the tax while not discriminating between different countries with different emissions. The second option makes a distinction between the efficiency of different countries and the emissions they produce. We propose at present the first and less aggressive option.This is intended to neutralise the competitiveness effect of the domestic tax. It is not necessarily to distinguish between products made in different countries, hence, it is not intended to be an aggressive trade policy. 

There should be an adjustment on exports and imports. Only UK consumers should be taxed. So all products that are consumed in the UK are going to be taxed. 

CO2 produced during the manufacturing process of a product needs to be estimated and the tax on the product must be proportional to CO2 emissions.

To make this concept more tangible, we can make an example for UK-made steel. The CO2 produced per kg for this product can be estimated. A corresponding amount would be charged on imports and the same amount would be refunded on exports. For products that are not manufactured in the UK, tariff can be estimated based on general estimation of how much CO2 is produced in making that good. 

Exports would be exempted from the tax. However, since the tax is charged upstream on import and extraction of fossil fuels, a system of refunding similar to VAT needs to be in place. However, the refund for a good being exported and the tariff on the same good being imported need to be the same, to prevent import-export tax arbitrage. 

## 

## Stacked Carbon Pricing: 

Stacked Carbon Pricing Is A Method of Charging for Carbon at the Border for High Carbon Intensity Goods. It also allows prioritisation of high-importance Carbon taxation. Most of all it is norm-based, it allows the separation of the tax paid from the incentive effect.

A layered carbon tax is a way of implementing a carbon tax that maximises the incentives to reduce emissions whilst minimising the political and economic barriers to a carbon tax's imposition. It does this by layering, and prioritisation.

It achieves this through a layered norm based approach. Each layer is revenue neutral and combines a tax on carbon intensive inputs with a subsidy on the outputs of that layer.

The production subsidy on the output of a layer is cancelled out in most cases by an equal and opposite tax on the consumption of that good in the next stage of the energy food chain.

So for example there might be a tax on fossil fuel inputs to electricity generation. Those taxes are used to fund a per kWh subsidy on electricity production. In stage 2, the consumption of electricity would then be taxed in exactly the same way .

Note therefore that at each stage there is the possibility of production that is not consumed within the country (exports) and consumption that is not produced within the country (imports). Note also how naturally these are dealt with by the tax system.

Production that is not consumed in the home country would be given a carbon tax combined with a per unit subsidy. Thus production at the average carbon intensity would face no net taxes, whereas production more dirty than average would face net taxes and production cleaner than average would face net subsidies.

In order to transform the effects of a carbon tax on the economy, we introduce a high level of incentive. Even a low level carbon tax has positive effects. The UK introduced a carbon tax, known as a carbon price floor in X. It eliminated coal power from the uk gwneation mix. Carbon tsaxated work. nut xcan we do better? Perhaps they can. The issue is: how high can your carbon tax be? So normally we say that a high carbon tax is politically difficult or economically challenging. I want to suggest a couple of ways in which it doesn't have to be so.

The first way is through output subsidies and the second is historical norms. You can move from one to the other. Output subsidise can be layered: the tax on one layer can be a tax on the next layer. Why have it at all, since it's cancels. Well firstly prioritisation and secondly imports and exports: it provides a useful way to deal with imports and exports of high embodied carbon goods.

A layered carbon tax is a way of implementing a carbon tax that maximises the incentives to reduce emissions at the same time as minimising the political and economic barriers to a carbon tax's imposition.

It achieves this through a layered norm based approach. Each layer is revenue neutral and combines a tax on carbon intensive inputs with a subsidy on the outputs of that layer.

The production subsidy on the output of a layer is cancelled out in most cases by an equal and opposite tax on the consumption of that good in the next stage of the energy food chain.

# 13.11 Food And Sin Taxes

## Alcohol and Tobacco

Alcohol and tobacco taxes would be retained as today. There may be a case for harmonisation across Europe, to prevent 'booze cruises'.

## Sugar Tax on Processed and Prepared Food

Excess sugar intake causes multiple health problems including obesity, type-II diabetes and tooth decay. We propose a simple sugar tax on the manufacture or importation of sugar based on three categories of sugar-like compounds. 

- Class A: 'sugar' (i.e., sucrose, glucose and fructose), including contents of fruit juice. 
- Class B: 'near sugar', including maltose etc. and synthetic and natural sweeteners with unclear health impacts.
- Class C: 'unprocessed' sugars in raw fruit and vegetables; starch and other carbohydrates.

Class A would have 100% tax (ie. £0.01 or 1p per gram sugar); class B, 50%  (ie. 0.5 pence per gram sugar); and class C 0%.

## Salt Tax on Processed and Prepared Food

We propose a simple salt tax on processed foods. This would be charged according to salt content.


# 13.12: Options For Welfare System

The present benefit system is a mixture of unconditional, conditional, means-tested, taxable and non-taxable payments. It is illogical and ill-thought through. Additionally,different means-tested benefits are means tested in different ways. The sum total of the system creates perverse incentives and does not encourage work effectively. Indeed, dealing with the benefits system is like a job in itself,both for the person claiming benefits and for the people administering benefits. This complexity is unnecessary because means-testing is just a tax in disguise: it takes away money from people as wages increase. Such a function is best performed by the income tax system, which also takes away money from people as wages increase. 

We propose a return to universal benefits with 'means testing' performed by the income tax system, rather than the benefits system, in an integrated and smooth way. The basic universal benefit in our proposed system is the Citizen's Dividend. It is a universal payment to all UK citizens. The Citizen's Dividend is a per capita payment to all citizens of the country, paid regardless of employment status. It is a universal payment to everyone in society who is a citizen of the UK. The payment would be initially equal to current income support levels, i.e, around £75 a week, or £3800 per year. 

There will be different rates for children (replacing child benefit and child tax credit, paid to mothers), working-age adults (replacing income support) and pensioners (equivalent to the existing state pension). It provides all UK citizens with the minimum amount of income. We also propose to offset payment of Citizen's Dividend against other taxes so taxpayers only receive a net bill or payment.

In addition, there will need to be further payments for particular categories of people with specific needs -- for example, disabled people, the elderly, carers and mothers with children. We propose that these payments would be made on a similar and consistent basis to the Citizen's Dividend described above. There will obviously need to be changes to the tax system in order to pay for these universal benefits but the system of government accounting should account for a means-tested benefit and a taxable universal benefit with increased income taxes the same way.

We also propose to offset payment of Citizen's Dividend against taxes. This would specifically apply to those taxes that are highly visible such as property taxes, so that individuals will receive or pay only the net amount of either taxes or benefits. 

## Integrated Skills Training-Workfare Schemes

The ideal education and welfare system include not only a (low) citizens income, around the current level of income support but also an integrated training, entrepreneurship and workfare scheme. The workfare system would be a system that pays a small wage but also develops the claimant's skill-set. This is also the purpose of some further education courses. Integrating workfare with training allows continual upgrading of the skill-set. Such training should always prepare the recipient both for employment and for entrepreneurship/self-employment. For example,mini-economies can be created in schools and universities to allow older school children to trade between themselves. The training-workfare college should develop these entrepreneurial skills further, removing one major barrier to entry to all industries, a general lack of entrepreneurial skills.

# 13.13 Introducing a Basic Income

## Basic Income 

This section describes the Citizens Income (a.k.a. Basic Income; Citizens Dividend) and a couple of ways that it could be introduced. The citizens Income is a per capita payment to all citizens of the country, paid regardless of employment status. It is intended to simplify the tax-benefit system; rather than means testing,the rest of the tax system is used to tax away the benefit. This Citizens Income provides everyone in the society with a minimum amount of income to live on. It's a way of compensating people for the inevitable costs resulting from the scarcity of natural things that are vital to life. The level of the Citizen's income might be, for example, around £75 per week, or around £3800per year. 

The citizen's income pays scarcity rents. If the fundamental things in life were not scarce for example if there were an infinite amount of land to grow food and live on and if the atmosphere was completely unlimited then there would be no need for a citizens income, just as there is no citizens income for the hunter-gatherer.In principle then, the citizens income compensates man for that which he loses when and he multiplies and lives in cities rather than being in the wild and living as a hunter gather. 

A Citizens income can be introduced as a simplification of the existing tax and benefit system.It would be paid from the tax department and replaces some existing benefits.It could be taxed away using income tax, so maxing explicit the effective taxes implicit in means testing, and allowing those rates to be smoothed and optimised. Also, as you increase taxes that the unemployed do not pay, also introduce a citizens income and net off the two. People with tax bills would only receive a net tax bill.

Our goal for the value of the Citizen's Dividend is the current level of income support.  We would abolish this benefit and replace it with a Citizen's Dividend paid to all. However, since the introduction of this dividend is expensive, it may need implementing slowly. For simplicity and political purposes, the dividend should be netted off against taxes paid, for example on property and land. Hence, people will receive only the net benefit or pay the net tax. 

## Different ways to fund a Basic Income

This article argues that there are *different types* of basic income, depending
on what the basic income replaces and how it is funded. Those types are a
*simplifying* basic income, a *compensating* basic income, a *redistributive*
basic income and an *extra* basic income. A simplifying basic income is paid for
by changes to income tax and pre-existing benefits; a *compensating* basic
income is paid for by increases in other taxes that are paid by all, such as a
carbon tax. A redistributive basic income is paid for by taxes on the rich;
whereas an *wealth fund* basic income is paid for by a wealth fund.

I argue that these are not just 'different ways to fund a basic income' but
rather they are inherently different overall propositions. A 'simplifying' basic
income does not change incomes very much but it does simplify the benefits
system. A compensating basic income's main rationale is to remove the regressive
effect of independently worthwhile policy. A redistributive basic income moves
money from rich to poor. And a wealth fund basic income increases national
savings by funding the transfers with asset purchases.

## A Simplifying Basic Income

The main goal of a simplifying basic income is to simplify the existing system
of welfare provision with lower benefit withdrawal rates and a more universal
aspect, so as to prevent the bureaucratic checks that accompany means testing
and conditionality. A strategy for implementing the simplifying basic income
would be to remove the personal allowance and find the 'common feature' across
many different schemes. Then add a basic income and at the same time reduce
benefits and allowances by the same amount across the board.

Typical tax increased: Income tax (personal allowance)

## A Compensating Basic Income

The reasoning behind a 'compensating' basic income is to compensate for changes
to taxes that would otherwise be undesirable because of their regressive effect.
Environmental taxes are desirable because they attempt to properly price
externalities. Health taxes aim to change behaviour of consumers and modify the
composition of produced foods. However, sometimes these taxes have a regressive
effect, because the poor spend more as a proportion of their income on food or
energy than the rich. A *compensating* basic income would redistribute these tax
revenues using the mechanism of the basic income. Examples of this approach
include a carbon tax combined with a basic income, referred to as the 'tax and
dividend' approach.

Typical tax increased: Carbon tax

## A Redistributive Basic Income

Like a compensating basic income, a redistributive basic income is also paid for
out of increased taxes. But in this case, the taxes that would be increased
would be taxes primarily on the rich. So for example, a Land Value Tax or
property tax falls more heavily on the rich.

There are variations of a redistributive basic income that can be tailored to
make a land value tax more palettable. For example, there could be a personal
allowance for property owners, and a basic income for non-property owners. In
that way, a property tax is made to favour those who own just one property.
Those who own more than one property will pay extra tax, whereas those that own
none get a compensating payment. This allowance would be equivalent to a 'basic
income for property owners' could then be extended using the funds raised by the
multiple property owners to those who are renting.

Typical tax increased: Land Value Tax (new tax)

## A Wealth Fund paying a Basic Income; Basic Property

Whereas the previous three example would be funded by increased taxes and/or
reduced other benefits, a wealth fund basic income would be funded by a wealth
fund. Wealth funds already exist, for example the Norwegian sovereign wealth
fund. In this case the wealth fund would buy assets such as equities, bonds,
land or property. The wealth fund would pay out dividends according to the
return (dividends, interest, rent) on the underlying assets.

But how would the assets themselves be financed? From which source? There are a
number of options: Taxation, Financial Surpluses from some other activity,
Government Borrowing, and Quantitative Easing.

An obvious example in this case would be corporation tax. Increased corporation
taxation would be used to purchase additional equities. In effect, companies
would be asked to pay an increased corporation tax in shares. This approach was
tried in Sweden for some time, and proved successful and popular. Companies paid
a portion of their taxes in shares, and this enhanced a fund that paid a basic
dividend to everyone.

Surpluses from local development are another method to fund the basic income.
For example, a local bank could be set up. This bank would purchase land/ lend
on land, and the surplus that it generates would be stored in a local social
fund. The dividends from the fund would then be used to pay a basic income. The
advantage of this approach is that the assets paying the fund would be
themselves useful to provide capital for the bank, and the dividends would also
be helpful

Another indirect way to fund a wealth fund basic income would be Quantitative
Easing or Bond Issuance, used to buy up assets, perhaps at the same time as
taxes were used to reduce those assets. Purchasing assets and taxing them act in
opposite directions in regards to the sale price of assets. Taxing an asset in
general would reduce its market price; purchasing that asset tends to inceease
the price. The introduction of taxes on assets at the same time as purchase of
assets, allows for financial stability at the same time as capture of surplus by
the authorities.

One step beyond a basic income is basic property. This would be a basic
requirement for property for all.

## The Case For Retaining A System of Contributions and Contribution Records in a Basic Income Scheme

The Beveridge report and the system of national insurance that it brought in,
amongst other things, have at its heart the dual ideas of universal benefits and
that of contributory benefits. Universal benefit is a benefit that is paid at
the same level whatever happens. Contributory benefits are those where tax or
national insurance contributions affect the future amount of benefits provided.

The Beveridge report argued *against* means testing, which can be defined as
taking away benefits as income increases. But the UK welfare state has
introduced means testing, a second income tax but this time only on the income
of those on benefits. Of course, taking money away from people as their income
rises is what income tax does, and it is odd that in the uk there are four
separate systems for doing this (income tax, employers and employees national
insurance, and means testing of benefits, soon integrated into a single benefit,
universal credit)

A simple and *integrated* tax and benefits system recognises that taxes and
means testing are essentially the same thing. A benefits system with a basic
income at its heart recognises that the high benefits withdrawal rates of the
current system. So a transition to a ?4000 per year basic income could be
financed (say).

## Contributory Basic Income Increases

It will be assumed here that we can fund a basic income from environmental
taxes. This would pay a basic income of £4000, but this would not be uprated
with inflation. In order to acheive our target of a basic income of £6000 per
person, the addition would be funded by actual securities purchased in the
market. The money raised to fund these purchases would be from the following
sources: taxes on company profits or wealth, money purchase of overseas
securities. The allocation of the tax paid would be to everyday people according
to the tax paid, up to some maximum value per year.

So for example if £2000 saving would be put into securities yielding 5% per
year, then the basic income next year (and thereafter) would be 5%\*£2000 = £100
extra per year. There would be two ways to earn these credits.

There would be two methods for saving this £1000. First, for every £ you pay in
income tax, you might get £1 of securities set aside for you. Second, the local
authority or national government could pay you for doing various community
actions.

Communities need maintenance. Public goods need to be paid for. This creates a
basic income scheme very much like the sort of scheme Beveridge intended, and
also the welfare schemes that many countries have, which have a 'contributory'
component. In other words, if you don't work,

It is intended to be the sort of scheme that represent the and financial
interests of 99% of the population and the value set of 80% of the population,
that build a broader coalition than egalitarianism alone to include community,
the work ethic, as well as simiplification and the national interest. Over time,
the scheme would move to being 'funded' perhaps by taxing multinational's shares
apportioned by sales so that ownership over time moves to the fund(s) paying the
basic income - a sovereign wealth fund in other words.

In summary, the scheme encourages community involvement, eliminates the
disincentive effects and deadweight cost of income tax for everyone earning less
than £50K per annum, and makes BI more palatable to people that subscribe to
ideas that our communities, public physical infrastructure and public goods need
maintenance and that work should be rewarded. All at no additional cost.

## A basic income with a tax contribution record.

The basic idea is as follows:

- Every current citizen is granted a right to a basic income of £4000 per
  year.
- Income tax paid (at 40%) between 0 and 10K is set aside to buy securities
  and thus increments additional amount to the basic income
- Whilst income between 0 and 10K is taxed, the taxpayer increases his or her
  benefit entitlement in so doing, with an exactly equivalent value.
- Community actions could also be paid in this benefit

## Politics of Basic Income

It seems to me that the major problem with basic income is that people aren't
happy with giving money for nothing. If however, it was funded, and there were
local organisations with balance sheets paying basic income out of a funded
balance sheet, then this would be perfect, because the income would not be seen
to be coming out of taxation. It would of course then reduce the tax burden for
the state. Taking the population seriously means that taking seriously the idea
that people will not just be interested in 'money for nothing'. Perhaps it also
means that people are interested in value for value created. But if you create
value in a community you should get a reward.

For the last few years, Britain has struggled with the idea of freedom of
movement. The UK, and particularly London, are attractive places for people
across the EU to move to, partly because of the English language, partly because
the economy was booming, and partly because the international and multicultural
nature of London in particular was very welcoming. But it has become clear that
some portion of the existing population did not feel much economic benefit from
this. A basic income if related to a real or notional personal wealth fund could
allow smooth earning of basic income by citizens and then for new residents to
'buy in' to this fund.

## Implementation

**Step 1: Introduction of Payment Card**

The citizen's dividend system would be introduced as a payment card for all
citizens (similar to an oyster card).

**Step 2: Simplifying Universal Credit**

Universal credit works like this: You can opt into the system, if you have been
on another benefit and you are in an area that UC has been rolled out to.
Universal credit replaces the following benefit types: Child Tax Credit; Housing
Benefit; Income Support; income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA):
income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA): Working Tax Credit. Once
you are in the system, it works like this: You have a standard payment, that is
set up as follows: - If you are are getting help with housing: you get a payment
of X per year, not including housing costs. - If you are not getting help with
housing: you get a payment of Y per year.

For those people in the universal credit system, replace it with a universal
payment and a standard benefits withdrawal rate of 40%. Now, a benefits
recipient would receive a universal benefit of ?4000 per year , and pay a
standard tax of 40% on all income coming in.

**Step 3: Simplifying Income Tax**

For people working, replace it with a basic income and the elimination of the
personal threshold. Simultaneously simplify the income tax, employees and
employers system to a standard rate of 40% and a higher rate of 60% for the
first percentile only. If you are in the PAYE system you get the basic income.

Now these two groups are on a basic income: - People earning over the personal
allowance - People qualifying for universal credit (how many are there?), and
legacy benefits to be replaced by universal credit. The participation basic
income would be paid in two circumstances. First, you are in work. Second, you
are in receipt of universal benefits and the legacy benefits that universal
benefit allows for.

**Step 4: Reduce Income taxes, Increase Externality Taxes**

The third step is to reduce again the basic rate of income tax, and replace it
with the carbon tax, at the same time bringing into the scheme those people who
aren't either recipients of universal credit, or full time workers above the
personal allowance (as was prior to the introduction of the scheme.

**Step 5: Basic Property Tax Free Allowance**

We adopt the same approach to property as with income. We first consider the
people who are taxed and the people on benefits and we adopt the same allowances
for these two groups. Those owning property and those on housing benefits should
have the same benefits. We then extend this allowance to all.

**Further Research**

So to start to model this we should try to find how many people are in each
bracket. How many people are in the working population, how many are in the
universal credit system and the prior legacy systems, and how many are in no
system at all?

# 13.14 Gordon Policy Ideas List

- Central Monetary Authority (CMA) responsible for the creation of all monetary credits.  Credits are uniquely numbered and traceable.  Credits are constantly analyzed for duplications.  Potentially located in Leeds not London.  Possibly move the financial capital of the UK to Leeds.
- All financial services companies nationalized without exception.  This should lower the cost of banking and insuring.
- All private vehicles to be automatically insured by the State Insurer for 3rd Party injury and costs - regardless of the nature and cause of the incident. Comprehensive insurance cover becomes mandatory for all drivers.  To not acquire it is criminal.  This will ensure that the 3% of drivers that fail to insure do not cause uninsured injury and costs to 3rd parties.  (I think it is Switzerland has this.)
- Corporation of the City of London abolished once it has been completely encircled as discussed.
- All assets of any kind in the UK must have a beneficial owner that can be phoned/written to, and taxed where necessary.  If a beneficial owner cannot be identified the asset will be sequestrated by the state and passed to the Citizens Dividend Trust for disposal or exploitation.  (PRC)
- Non-residents can own no property of any kind in the UK.  The resident must be the beneficial owner.  If there is any suspicion that the resident is house-sitting to enable a non-resident to speculatively own property in the UK the property will be sequestrated by the state and the resident concerned prosecuted for fraud.  (PRC)
- No property can be owned at any point in a chain of ownership by any listed secrecy/tax haven including the CCL or Delaware, for example.
- Once nationalized, the London Stock Exchange will be promoted as a --Traditional Stock Market-- for real investors.  Once purchased, a stock must be held for a minimum of 3 months, thereafter no more than 1% of any company can be sold in one week by a single investor, and there will be a one week delay on the sale with the final sale price being set at the end of that week.  We will sell the benefit of the LSE as being real growth in share price due to the fundamental value of the company increasing, and a revenue stream from dividends.  I believe that 'real' investors and companies will flock to London for such an opportunity.  In a way it is a niche play in a global market.  We will actively assist companies that want to relocate to the LSE.
- Smaller markets can be set up in other regional hubs e.g. Leeds, Birmingham etc. for smaller companies e.g. AIM, and a new Micro-AIM
- RBS, Lloyds, Barclays (and possibly HSBC assets in the UK) and other bankrupted banking interests to be absorbed into four new State Banks.  Scientific, Industrial & Manufacturing Bank of the United Kingdom (SIMB-UK); Property, Infrastructure & Construction Bank of the United Kingdom (PICB-UK); Savings & Loan Bank of the United Kingdom (SLB-UK); and International Development Bank of the United Kingdom (IDB-UK).  Each bank will borrow money directly from the CMA and lend according to a national lending plan.  Savings will be underwritten by the state and guaranteed savings rates set.  Aimed at loans and overdrafts in excess of £50,000 so as not to compete with local Savings and Loan Mutuals.
- 650 locally owned Savings and Loan mutual organisations to be formed for each political constituency.  Each SLMO will have a local resident as Managing Director, two additional local directors (each with skin in the game -- possibly £50,000 for the MD and £25,000 each for other Directors), and a board (aufsichsrat) made up of the local MP, council representative, Union representative, and other key interested local parties.  It will follow the Bank on Dave model.  It will be allowed to do micro-loans up to £50,000 to any individual entity, with a maximum deposit of £50,000 by any local resident.  No constituency outsiders may deposit or borrow from any SLMO -- they must be completely local operations aimed at the local economy.  Burnley S&L:  5% AER on savings, and 8.9 to 14.9% interest on loans.  No bonuses of any kind to any staff.  Surpluses go to local charities.
- A massive apprenticeship-training program to be developed in direct consultation with UK businesses.  At least 250,000 apprentices entering formal technical apprenticeships each year with a minimum of 1,000,000 people under full-time hardcore technical instruction at any one time.  This will require the importation of English speaking trainers from all around the World.  The UK simply does not have enough people available to train our future generations.  A minimum of 100,000 trainers will be required, possibly as many as 250,000 employed in training and administration.
- Most prisons and detention centers to be turned into apprenticeship training hubs.  Qualifying inmates will be trained to Master Craftsman Level and, if deemed safe, will qualify to train other inmates, and eventually civilians in adjacent facilities.  Exceptional progress will be rewarded with early release if deemed appropriate.  Prison apprenticeship programs will be coordinated in close consultation with regional industry.
- University education to be made free or heavily subsidized for courses considered being in the 'national interest'.  This will cover a wide range of scientific, academic, and technical disciplines.  A grading system will determine the amount of subsidy from 100% free through to 100% paid.
- Citizens Dividend to be paid unconditionally to all UK citizens.  New citizens must wait five years to qualify.  (Prisoners to pay 33% of their CD to the state to compensate for their keep.  The rest will be held in trust with 5% AER to cushion their release into society.  If they perish in captivity the money reverts to the CDT.)  Suggested payments:  £250 per month for 0-16 years of age; £500 for 16 to 65; and £750 thereafter. (numbers completely open to debate, as always with me)
- CD to be paid into an account at the SLB-UK.  All citizens that apply for and claim their CD must apply in person and present themselves for interview in private (if a person is considered to be vulnerable in any way, they will be provided with free state legal representation for the purposes of determining their wishes).  Each successful applicant will be issued with a banking card that doubles for a biometric Citizens Identification Card.  If a person does not want to subscribe to the ID Card system, they do not qualify for the Citizens Dividend.
- Police will have the right to ask any person to present their ID Card upon request.  Failure to do so may result in detention and further investigation.  Alternatives to presenting the card will be voluntary scan of the iris or fingers veins to determine identify.
- Police to revert to the Bobby on the Bear model.  Velvet zero tolerance policing worked spectacularly in Hartlepool and Middlesbrough under Ray Mallon.  That approach halts the progression from minor misdemeanors to major crime in a highly effective way.
- Youth offenders and their families should be offered the opportunity to trade custodial sentences to technical apprenticeships on probation.
- Courts to introduce fast-track/short-form sentencing for youth offenders. Under 25's should be sentenced within one week of any minor to moderate offense; any longer and the perpetrator often ceases to connect the punishment to the crime.  This fast-track process could be elective.  
- Qualifying adults sentenced to a custodial term may elect to convert their sentence to national service in the military.  Specialized military units can be formed to take these individuals.
- One of the greatest criticisms of Government is that loud pressure groups, lobbyists, and leaders of big business have too much direct access to Numbers 10 and 11 and adversely influence decision making in Government.  To combat this I propose the following:  Number 10 will create a 200-person strong --Public Concern Project Management Team (PCPMT)-- which receives submissions and calls from the public, pressure groups, lobbyists, foreigners and big business.  (All submissions will be entered on a database that is accessible directly by the Prime Minister.  The PM will have his own personal team reviewing all submissions and auditing the PCPMT to ensure that projects cannot be buried.)  Each 'customer' will receive a 'case number' and be assigned a Personal Project Manager.  The Project Manager will take up the issue personally and seek to resolve the issue without additional resource.  If the issue remains unresolved it will be elevated to a Senior Project Manager.  If the senior project manager is unable to resolve the issue it will go up to an Expert Committee chaired by a Cabinet Minister.  Each of these ten committees will have a team of highly skilled researchers and assistants to call upon.  Level 7 will reorganise the cabinet and government departmental responsibility around the ten books with one cabinet minister for each of the ten books.  Each cabinet minster will chair an Expert Committee of ten experts drawn from outside Government.  One of their tasks will be to review unresolved complaints to the Senior Project Managers of the PCPMT.  If the Expert Committee is unable to resolve the matter it will elevate to the Prime Minister, and that's when I get involved personally.  Each month all complaints will be analysed for patterns, summarized and presented in a four-hour session each week to the Prime Minister.  The benefits of such a system are, 1) reduce corrupting influence by pressure groups, lobbyists, and big business, 2) prove to the public that we are there to help, listening to everyone, and genuinely serving the wider public through pragmatic action, 3) head-off social and political unrest before it gets out of control, and 4) ensure that corruption and incompetence in wider government and the public sector cannot metastasise and is stamped out early. 
- **TEAR**: A Level 7 system for the reduction of 'Bads' when initiated by Government -- (Possible meme:  tearing down the old system before it reduces us all to tears): 

1) **T**ax the 'Bad', this is a common and acceptable method

2) Widespread **E**ducation over a protracted period of the citizens

3) The citizenry reaching broad **A**greement, and finally if all else fails

4) Forced **R**estrictions and quotas on the 'bad'

or

- Another key policy that will negate the need for Government paying out for future pension contributions is the implementation of mandatory Social Welfare payments that we intend implementing for all registered 'tax payers'.  As in China, even if they don't pay tax, people will be required to pay a mandatory 5% to 10% of their salary into a Social Welfare fund that can be used primarily as a pension.  It will be tax free up to 10%.  That's very high.  The taxpayer can choose to receive a fixed 5% interest from the Government, or they can put up to 66% of it into riskier investments such as stocks and shares.  Then there is every incentive to save for retirement.  It will only pay out at 65 years of age.  Even putting 5% of income away for 20 or 30 years with 5% to 8% interest, and assuming we can keep inflation to 3% or below, and added to the Citizen's Dividend, should provide most people with a livable pension.  This removes much of the liability from the Government outside of the Citizen's Dividend of GBP 9,000 per year for 65+ people.

# 13.15 Simple Policy Proposals

This section proposes a simple tax system which aims to fulfils our requirements of being beneficial, fair and practical. These proposed policies, and the related transitional arrangements, aim to resolve issues around incentives and redistribution in the current UK tax system in a politically achievable way. 

## Main Taxes

1. Replace Business Rates and Council tax with a norm-based LVT consisting of a 100% LVT on increases in land rent. Transition the residual tax to a tax on land wealth.
2. Replace VAT and Corporation tax with a 'Dyson' Tax (Cashflow Tax) with half deductability for imports from VAT compliant non-tax havens.  
3. Introduce a corporate wealth tax on the same principles as the Dyson tax (i.e. combined with a witholding tax on payments abroad from the UK) 
4. Introduce a layered upstream consumption based Carbon Incentive. Transition this over time to an upstream Consumption based Carbon Tax plus Citizen's Dividend.
5. Simplify Income Tax and NI with a simple progressive income tax system with a very simple rate structure. (The exact details of the rate structure and basic income depend on accurate modelling of the tax system)

## Benefits

1. Replace unemployment benefit with a payment by results conditional work-training hybrid
2. Slowly introduce a citizen's dividend as a compensating payment for additional consumption taxes.
3. Pay for housing benefit automatically out of LVT.
4. Retain other benefits, but fold all means testing into the income tax system, with maximum means testing amount equal to the tax paid on the personal allowance
5. Once this is acheived it is easy, if required, to abolish all personal allowances and replace the whole system with a basic income with additional payments conditional on disability/carer/age status.

## Further minor taxes

1. Introduce congestion charges in lieu of a carbon tax on transport fuels.
2. Introduce comprehensive environmental and health taxation (packaging tax, sugar, meat tax, and others if needed).
3. Increase the bank balance sheet tax and adapt it counter-cyclically and alter it to favour lending to real businesses.
4. Introduce a comprehensive wealth register. This may take the form of a disclosure requirement on all UK wealth owned by foreigners and on ownership of foreign wealth by uk residents. Combine with a small 0.1% wealth tax on both of these classes of wealth.
