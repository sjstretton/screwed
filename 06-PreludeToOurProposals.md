# PART 13: PRELUDE TO OUR PROPOSALS



# 13.2 The Mirrlees Review

Our starting point in building our proposals were the recommendations of the Mirrlees review [@Mirrlees2010]. This document suggested a number of key reforms of the UK tax system, so as to create effective incentives for a better functioning society. It also discussed different approaches to the taxation of income invested, with particular reference to whether whether gains or the final consumption are taxed. The review does not cover the benefit system. The recommendations of the summary reportare as follows:

1. Replace Business Rates with a Land Value Tax
2. Reform Council tax (and transactions) into a single simple tax on property.
3. Remove exemptions from VAT and refund by increases in benefits and allowances
4. Introduce congestion charging
5. Rationalise the approach to greenhouse gas (carbon) taxation
6. Remove transaction taxes (stamp duties) as highly economically distorting.
7. Introduce a consistent approach for dealing with the VAT exception of financial services (especially when bundled with other services)
8. Simplify where possible.
9. Introduce an allowance for corporate equity (ACE) to eliminate the favouring of debt financing over equity.

We use these proposals to guide our own recommendations for new policies. 

# 13.3 Philosophy of Our Proposals

In this section we explain our guiding philosophy and define a simple set of proposals that may help achieve an ideal taxation system. The guiding principles here are that the system will be beneficial, fair, and practical.

## Beneficiaries

Our new tax system considers the citizens of the UK to be akin to the 'shareholders' of a company, with a stake in the outcome of the country. These citizens are therefore the intended beneficiaries of the tax system. The 'paying customers' of this system should be the property owners, particularly the owners of UK land and anyone profiting from, or otherwise building wealth by selling goods and services to, UK consumers. This also should apply to those individuals/organisations which are otherwise receiving payments from the UK. The tax system should charge them for this benefit received.

## Changing Incentives

Income, Wealth and Environmental Damage of Consumption should be taxed. Personal Incomes are already adequately taxed, while Wealth and Environmental Damages are not. The main goal of our wealth taxation proposals is to tax the top 1% (and particularly the top 0.1%) by wealth. This can be achieved by taxing all forms of wealth, with allowances/subsidies granted to those who remain resident in the UK. We also propose to properly regulate environmental damage through the application of a Carbon tax, which should help incentivise more sustainable consumer behaviour. 

## Avoiding Avoidance

Under the new system, you would receive *tax benefits* from residing in the UK. Land is an inelastic base of taxation, as it is unable to be moved, and alongside the profits from consumption by UK customers. Non resident foreigners who own UK assets will be treated in an equivalent way to the UK super rich - with high levels of taxation applied to their UK holdings. 

## Simplicity is key

The tax system should be as simple as possible. Thus we simplify wherever possible. Moreover, where and if there are options for making the tax system automatic, we should take them. This system should not need or involve any 'self assessment', which can often act as an extra barrier to engaging fully with the system.

## Privacy and Transparency

The new tax system should have privacy for ordinary members of the public. That could be achieved by the assignment of secure identities to taxpayers which are independent of their real identity (so that name or address would be separately stored than the 'tax' identity). This would ensure the safety of the citizens of the UK. There may however be a case made for the complete transparency of the very rich (0.1% by wealth or income) and major companies. This would be part of a check-and-balance mechanism is in place to regulate political and financial influence within the UK.

# 13.4 Institutional Reforms

## Residency Allowance

As mentioned above, the new tax system would shift incentives to ensure that there were strong tax benefits to maintaining UK residency (i.e. a residency allowance). This would replace tax benefits for offshore or non-dom status. The super rich and the offshore resident owners would therefore be treated equivalently, with steep tax rates,  unless the offshore residents reside in a trusted partner country with good disclosure mechanisms on taxable assets (e.g. an EU country).

## Local Taxation

Taxes on housing should be transformed over time into a 100% Land Value Tax, plus a wealth allowance. The exact size of this wealth allowance could be decided by local authorities. Local authorities would therefore be funded by a progressive land wealth tax. Any uplift in land rental values should be distributed 50-50 between local authorities and national authorities. This LVT could be adjusted for the effect of any infrastructure investments on land values, where 100% of the uplift would be captured by the authority making the investment. 

## Strategic Tax Reform

Instead of having an annual budget, the tax system should be treated strategically. In other words, it would be run much like the strategic spending and defence review - namely a 'strategic tax review'.
