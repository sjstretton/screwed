# PART 13: PRELUDE TO OUR PROPOSALS

# 13.1 Overview

In this book, we have compared the Tax and Welfare system to an operating system - a mechanism of levers through which society is run, funds are raised, and public services are delivered. Using this metaphor, we have been able to troubleshoot the bugs in the current system and illustrate why the UK has seen increasing inequality of outcomes between the best- and the worst-off in our society. 

We have an unwieldy, overly complex tax and welfare system in which the rich get richer, while those on the bottom and in the middle income classes see their income and wealth stagnate. By delivering benefits on a means-tested basis, our benefit system doesn't encourage re-entering employment.

Early on in this book, we outlined the framework with which we would structure our evaluation of the UK tax system, by building on Beveridge's work in fighting his five great evils of society. These guiding principles structure our analysis. We argue for a tax system that is fair and leads to greater equality of opportunity amongst its members. It should be beneficial and contribute to the sustainable and ethical development of society. Finally, such a system should be practical in its administration and application. 

Taxes, amongst their other roles of nudging incentives and redistributing income, are predominately aimed at financing public provision of goods and services - including welfare for the most needy in society. Therefore, we emphasise that these three balls need to be balanced carefully so as to ensure that the UK's Tax and Welfare system helps us build the society that we aim to achieve.

We summarise the findings from our discussion below. Broadly, on the whole, we propose to simplify the income tax and benefit system, and augment taxes where there is a social outcome that needs to be achieved through discouraging negative behaviour. A comprehensive Land Value Tax (LVT) would be phased in, so as to ensure that land was successfully developed, such that any excess rent could be captured and the windfall redistributed.

Our proposals should be considered interim, since we have not yet completed accurate modelling of all their effects.

## Summary

The following table shows both the final strategic objective and the intermediate/transitional one.

# 13.2 The Mirrlees Review

Our starting point in building our proposals were the recommendations of the Mirrlees review [@Mirrlees2010]. This document suggested a number of key reforms of the UK tax system, so as to create effective incentives for a better functioning society. It also discussed different approaches to the taxation of income invested, with particular reference to whether whether gains or the final consumption are taxed. The review does not cover the benefit system. The recommendations of the summary reportare as follows:

1. Replace Business Rates with a Land Value Tax
2. Reform Council tax (and transactions) into a single simple tax on property.
3. Remove exemptions from VAT and refund by increases in benefits and allowances
4. Introduce congestion charging
5. Rationalise the approach to greenhouse gas (carbon) taxation
6. Remove transaction taxes (stamp duties) as highly economically distorting.
7. Introduce a consistent approach for dealing with the VAT exception of financial services (especially when bundled with other services)
8. Simplify where possible.
9. Introduce an allowance for corporate equity (ACE) to eliminate the favouring of debt financing over equity.

We use these proposals to guide our own recommendations for new policies. 

# 13.3 Philosophy of Our Proposals

In this section we explain our guiding philosophy and define a simple set of proposals that may help achieve an ideal taxation system. The guiding principles here are that the system will be beneficial, fair, and practical.

## Beneficiaries

Our new tax system considers the citizens of the UK to be akin to the 'shareholders' of a company, with a stake in the outcome of the country. These citizens are therefore the intended beneficiaries of the tax system. The 'paying customers' of this system should be the property owners, particularly the owners of UK land and anyone profiting from, or otherwise building wealth by selling goods and services to, UK consumers. This also should apply to those individuals/organisations which are otherwise receiving payments from the UK. The tax system should charge them for this benefit received.

## Changing Incentives

Income, Wealth and Environmental Damage of Consumption should be taxed. Personal Incomes are already adequately taxed, while Wealth and Environmental Damages are not. The main goal of our wealth taxation proposals is to tax the top 1% (and particularly the top 0.1%) by wealth. This can be achieved by taxing all forms of wealth, with allowances/subsidies granted to those who remain resident in the UK. We also propose to properly regulate environmental damage through the application of a Carbon tax, which should help incentivise more sustainable consumer behaviour. 

## Avoiding Avoidance

Under the new system, you would receive *tax benefits* from residing in the UK. Land is an inelastic base of taxation, as it is unable to be moved, and alongside the profits from consumption by UK customers. Non resident foreigners who own UK assets will be treated in an equivalent way to the UK super rich - with high levels of taxation applied to their UK holdings. 

## Simplicity is key

The tax system should be as simple as possible. Thus we simplify wherever possible. Moreover, where and if there are options for making the tax system automatic, we should take them. This system should not need or involve any 'self assessment', which can often act as an extra barrier to engaging fully with the system.

## Privacy and Transparency

The new tax system should have privacy for ordinary members of the public. That could be achieved by the assignment of secure identities to taxpayers which are independent of their real identity (so that name or address would be separately stored than the 'tax' identity). This would ensure the safety of the citizens of the UK. There may however be a case made for the complete transparency of the very rich (0.1% by wealth or income) and major companies. This would be part of a check-and-balance mechanism is in place to regulate political and financial influence within the UK.

# 13.4 Institutional Reforms

## Residency Allowance

As mentioned above, the new tax system would shift incentives to ensure that there were strong tax benefits to maintaining UK residency (i.e. a residency allowance). This would replace tax benefits for offshore or non-dom status. The super rich and the offshore resident owners would therefore be treated equivalently, with steep tax rates,  unless the offshore residents reside in a trusted partner country with good disclosure mechanisms on taxable assets (e.g. an EU country).

## Local Taxation

Taxes on housing should be transformed over time into a 100% Land Value Tax, plus a wealth allowance. The exact size of this wealth allowance could be decided by local authorities. Local authorities would therefore be funded by a progressive land wealth tax. Any uplift in land rental values should be distributed 50-50 between local authorities and national authorities. This LVT could be adjusted for the effect of any infrastructure investments on land values, where 100% of the uplift would be captured by the authority making the investment. 

## Strategic Tax Reform

Instead of having an annual budget, the tax system should be treated strategically. In other words, it would be run much like the strategic spending and defence review - namely a 'strategic tax review'.

# 13.5 Transitional Questions

To ensure that these new proposals are implemented successfully, any transition to the new taxation system would need to to account for the following three effects. 

1) First the transition must be *practical* and *simple* to understand.
2) Second the transition should be, and be seen to be, *fair*.
3) Third the transition should be seen to be *beneficial* in the short term as well as the long term.

Asset value effects are important in this. These are important both from the fairness persective and from the perspective of economic benefit. Volatile rises and falls in asset values are arguably unfair -rises because the people who receive these rises are not necessarily deserving of it; and likewise for any falls. Both of these impacts can be amplificed through ineffective application of government policy. For example, two major government policies -not revaluing Council tax and reductions in long term interest rates - have caused national house price increases.

# 13.14 Gordon Policy Ideas List

- Central Monetary Authority (CMA) responsible for the creation of all monetary credits.  Credits are uniquely numbered and traceable.  Credits are constantly analyzed for duplications.  Potentially located in Leeds not London.  Possibly move the financial capital of the UK to Leeds.
- All financial services companies nationalized without exception.  This should lower the cost of banking and insuring.
- All private vehicles to be automatically insured by the State Insurer for 3rd Party injury and costs - regardless of the nature and cause of the incident. Comprehensive insurance cover becomes mandatory for all drivers.  To not acquire it is criminal.  This will ensure that the 3% of drivers that fail to insure do not cause uninsured injury and costs to 3rd parties.  (I think it is Switzerland has this.)
- Corporation of the City of London abolished once it has been completely encircled as discussed.
- All assets of any kind in the UK must have a beneficial owner that can be phoned/written to, and taxed where necessary.  If a beneficial owner cannot be identified the asset will be sequestrated by the state and passed to the Citizens Dividend Trust for disposal or exploitation.  (PRC)
- Non-residents can own no property of any kind in the UK.  The resident must be the beneficial owner.  If there is any suspicion that the resident is house-sitting to enable a non-resident to speculatively own property in the UK the property will be sequestrated by the state and the resident concerned prosecuted for fraud.  (PRC)
- No property can be owned at any point in a chain of ownership by any listed secrecy/tax haven including the CCL or Delaware, for example.
- Once nationalized, the London Stock Exchange will be promoted as a --Traditional Stock Market-- for real investors.  Once purchased, a stock must be held for a minimum of 3 months, thereafter no more than 1% of any company can be sold in one week by a single investor, and there will be a one week delay on the sale with the final sale price being set at the end of that week.  We will sell the benefit of the LSE as being real growth in share price due to the fundamental value of the company increasing, and a revenue stream from dividends.  I believe that 'real' investors and companies will flock to London for such an opportunity.  In a way it is a niche play in a global market.  We will actively assist companies that want to relocate to the LSE.
- Smaller markets can be set up in other regional hubs e.g. Leeds, Birmingham etc. for smaller companies e.g. AIM, and a new Micro-AIM
- RBS, Lloyds, Barclays (and possibly HSBC assets in the UK) and other bankrupted banking interests to be absorbed into four new State Banks.  Scientific, Industrial & Manufacturing Bank of the United Kingdom (SIMB-UK); Property, Infrastructure & Construction Bank of the United Kingdom (PICB-UK); Savings & Loan Bank of the United Kingdom (SLB-UK); and International Development Bank of the United Kingdom (IDB-UK).  Each bank will borrow money directly from the CMA and lend according to a national lending plan.  Savings will be underwritten by the state and guaranteed savings rates set.  Aimed at loans and overdrafts in excess of £50,000 so as not to compete with local Savings and Loan Mutuals.
- 650 locally owned Savings and Loan mutual organisations to be formed for each political constituency.  Each SLMO will have a local resident as Managing Director, two additional local directors (each with skin in the game -- possibly £50,000 for the MD and £25,000 each for other Directors), and a board (aufsichsrat) made up of the local MP, council representative, Union representative, and other key interested local parties.  It will follow the Bank on Dave model.  It will be allowed to do micro-loans up to £50,000 to any individual entity, with a maximum deposit of £50,000 by any local resident.  No constituency outsiders may deposit or borrow from any SLMO -- they must be completely local operations aimed at the local economy.  Burnley S&L:  5% AER on savings, and 8.9 to 14.9% interest on loans.  No bonuses of any kind to any staff.  Surpluses go to local charities.
- A massive apprenticeship-training program to be developed in direct consultation with UK businesses.  At least 250,000 apprentices entering formal technical apprenticeships each year with a minimum of 1,000,000 people under full-time hardcore technical instruction at any one time.  This will require the importation of English speaking trainers from all around the World.  The UK simply does not have enough people available to train our future generations.  A minimum of 100,000 trainers will be required, possibly as many as 250,000 employed in training and administration.
- Most prisons and detention centers to be turned into apprenticeship training hubs.  Qualifying inmates will be trained to Master Craftsman Level and, if deemed safe, will qualify to train other inmates, and eventually civilians in adjacent facilities.  Exceptional progress will be rewarded with early release if deemed appropriate.  Prison apprenticeship programs will be coordinated in close consultation with regional industry.
- University education to be made free or heavily subsidized for courses considered being in the 'national interest'.  This will cover a wide range of scientific, academic, and technical disciplines.  A grading system will determine the amount of subsidy from 100% free through to 100% paid.
- Citizens Dividend to be paid unconditionally to all UK citizens.  New citizens must wait five years to qualify.  (Prisoners to pay 33% of their CD to the state to compensate for their keep.  The rest will be held in trust with 5% AER to cushion their release into society.  If they perish in captivity the money reverts to the CDT.)  Suggested payments:  £250 per month for 0-16 years of age; £500 for 16 to 65; and £750 thereafter. (numbers completely open to debate, as always with me)
- CD to be paid into an account at the SLB-UK.  All citizens that apply for and claim their CD must apply in person and present themselves for interview in private (if a person is considered to be vulnerable in any way, they will be provided with free state legal representation for the purposes of determining their wishes).  Each successful applicant will be issued with a banking card that doubles for a biometric Citizens Identification Card.  If a person does not want to subscribe to the ID Card system, they do not qualify for the Citizens Dividend.
- Police will have the right to ask any person to present their ID Card upon request.  Failure to do so may result in detention and further investigation.  Alternatives to presenting the card will be voluntary scan of the iris or fingers veins to determine identify.
- Police to revert to the Bobby on the Bear model.  Velvet zero tolerance policing worked spectacularly in Hartlepool and Middlesbrough under Ray Mallon.  That approach halts the progression from minor misdemeanors to major crime in a highly effective way.
- Youth offenders and their families should be offered the opportunity to trade custodial sentences to technical apprenticeships on probation.
- Courts to introduce fast-track/short-form sentencing for youth offenders. Under 25's should be sentenced within one week of any minor to moderate offense; any longer and the perpetrator often ceases to connect the punishment to the crime.  This fast-track process could be elective.  
- Qualifying adults sentenced to a custodial term may elect to convert their sentence to national service in the military.  Specialized military units can be formed to take these individuals.
- One of the greatest criticisms of Government is that loud pressure groups, lobbyists, and leaders of big business have too much direct access to Numbers 10 and 11 and adversely influence decision making in Government.  To combat this I propose the following:  Number 10 will create a 200-person strong --Public Concern Project Management Team (PCPMT)-- which receives submissions and calls from the public, pressure groups, lobbyists, foreigners and big business.  (All submissions will be entered on a database that is accessible directly by the Prime Minister.  The PM will have his own personal team reviewing all submissions and auditing the PCPMT to ensure that projects cannot be buried.)  Each 'customer' will receive a 'case number' and be assigned a Personal Project Manager.  The Project Manager will take up the issue personally and seek to resolve the issue without additional resource.  If the issue remains unresolved it will be elevated to a Senior Project Manager.  If the senior project manager is unable to resolve the issue it will go up to an Expert Committee chaired by a Cabinet Minister.  Each of these ten committees will have a team of highly skilled researchers and assistants to call upon.  Level 7 will reorganise the cabinet and government departmental responsibility around the ten books with one cabinet minister for each of the ten books.  Each cabinet minster will chair an Expert Committee of ten experts drawn from outside Government.  One of their tasks will be to review unresolved complaints to the Senior Project Managers of the PCPMT.  If the Expert Committee is unable to resolve the matter it will elevate to the Prime Minister, and that's when I get involved personally.  Each month all complaints will be analysed for patterns, summarized and presented in a four-hour session each week to the Prime Minister.  The benefits of such a system are, 1) reduce corrupting influence by pressure groups, lobbyists, and big business, 2) prove to the public that we are there to help, listening to everyone, and genuinely serving the wider public through pragmatic action, 3) head-off social and political unrest before it gets out of control, and 4) ensure that corruption and incompetence in wider government and the public sector cannot metastasise and is stamped out early. 
- **TEAR**: A Level 7 system for the reduction of 'Bads' when initiated by Government -- (Possible meme:  tearing down the old system before it reduces us all to tears): 

1) **T**ax the 'Bad', this is a common and acceptable method

2) Widespread **E**ducation over a protracted period of the citizens

3) The citizenry reaching broad **A**greement, and finally if all else fails

4) Forced **R**estrictions and quotas on the 'bad'

or

**EATER**:  Education, Agreement, Tax, Exercise, Experimentation, Experience & more Education, then Restrict.

- Another key policy that will negate the need for Government paying out for future pension contributions is the implementation of mandatory Social Welfare payments that we intend implementing for all registered 'tax payers'.  As in China, even if they don't pay tax, people will be required to pay a mandatory 5% to 10% of their salary into a Social Welfare fund that can be used primarily as a pension.  It will be tax free up to 10%.  That's very high.  The taxpayer can choose to receive a fixed 5% interest from the Government, or they can put up to 66% of it into riskier investments such as stocks and shares.  Then there is every incentive to save for retirement.  It will only pay out at 65 years of age.  Even putting 5% of income away for 20 or 30 years with 5% to 8% interest, and assuming we can keep inflation to 3% or below, and added to the Citizen's Dividend, should provide most people with a livable pension.  This removes much of the liability from the Government outside of the Citizen's Dividend of GBP 9,000 per year for 65+ people.
