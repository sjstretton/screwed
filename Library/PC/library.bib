@book{Soediono1989b,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Lozada1995,
abstract = {Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen's criticisms, added to those of physicists and philosophers, result in a definitive refutation of Boltzmann's claim that his H-theorem derives the Second Law of Thermodynamics solely from Newtonian Mechanics. Some authors using Boltzmann's Statistical Mechanics go so far as to claim that perpetual motion machines are feasible in principle; this is also incorrect. Modern approaches by Ilya Prigogine and by the "Astrophysical School" to build thermodynamics on a basis that avoids Georgescu-Roegen's objections are surveyed. These conclusions have both epistemological and technological importance for economics; this paper emphasizes the former. The epistemological argument is: (1) The entropy law is an evolutionary law. (2) Modern neoclassical economics is arithmomorphic. (3) Arithmomorphic laws cannot capture evolutionary changes. (4) Hence neoclassical economics cannot incorporate the entropy law's implications for the economic process. (5) If one can show that modern physicists use evolutionary laws despite their non-arithmomorphic nature, then maybe (6) economists will become accepting of evolutionary laws. (7) This would be good because the entropy law, which is evolutionary (point 1), has important implications for economics. This paper primarily treats the most unfamiliar point for non-physicists, point 5.},

It is in this context that this edition of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture highlights the vital role of fisheries and aquaculture in both food and nutrition security as well as economic expansion. The sector remains a major supplier of high-quality animal protein and supports the livelihoods and well-being of more than ten percent of the world's population. International trade in fish has reached new peaks as overall production has continued to rise. Yet, as the document underlines, an array of problems – ranging from the need for more effective governance to that of ensuring environmental sustainability – threatens to undermine the sector's valuable contribution to alleviating hunger and reducing poverty. Using the latest available statistics on fisheries and aquaculture, this edition presents a global analysis of the sector's status and trends. It also examines broader related issues such as gender, emergency preparedness and the ecosystem approach to fisheries and aquaculture. Selected highlights, from ecolabelling and certification to the effects of fisheries management policies on fishing safety, provide insights on specific topics. Finally, the document looks at the opportunities and difficulties for capture fisheries in the coming decades.},

abstract = {Contemporary science is preoccupied with that which exists; it rarely accounts for what is missing. But often the key to a system's persistence lies with information concerning lacunae. Information theory (IT), predicated as it is on the indeterminacies of existence, constitutes a natural tool for quantifying the beneficial reserves that lacunae can afford a system in its response to disturbance. In the format of IT, unutilized reserve capacity is complementary to the effective performance of the system, and too little of either attribute can render a system unsustainable. The fundamental calculus of IT provides a uniform way to quantify both essential attributes – effective performance and reserve capacity – and results in a single metric that gauges system sustainability (robustness) in terms of the tradeoff allotment of each. Furthermore, the same mathematics allows one to identify the domain of robust balance as delimited to a “window of vitality” that circumscribes sustainable behavior in ecosystems. Sensitivity analysis on this robustness function with respect to each individual component process quantifies the value of that link “at the margin”, i.e., how much each unit of that process contributes to moving the system towards its most sustainable configuration. The analysis provides heretofore missing theoretical justification for efforts to preserve biodiversity whenever systems have become too streamlined and efficient. Similar considerations should apply as well to economic systems, where fostering diversity among economic processes and currencies appears warranted in the face of over-development.},

abstract = {Recently, the maximum entropy principle has been applied to explain the evolution of com- plex non-equilibrium systems, such as the Earth system. I argue that it can also be fruitfully deployed to reconsider the classical treatment of entropy in economics by Georgescu-Roegen, if the growth of knowledge is seen as a physical process. Relying on central categories of Peirce's theory of signs, I follow the lines of a naturalistic evolutionary epistemology. In this framework, the three principles of Maximum Entropy (Jaynes), Maximum Power (Lotka) and Maximum Entropy Production can be arranged in a way such that evolution can be conceived as a process that manifests the physical tendency to maximize information generation and information capacity. This implies that the growth of knowledge is the dual of the process of entropy production. This theory matches with recent empirical research showing that eco- nomic growth can be tracked by measures of the throughput of useful work, mediated by the thermodynamic efficiency of the conversion of exergy into useful work.},

They are set at levels that do not reflect environmental damage, notably global warming, air pollution, and various side effects of motor vehicle use. In so doing, many countries raise too much revenue from direct taxes on work effort and capital accumulation and too little from taxes on energy use. This book is about getting energy prices right. The principle that fiscal instruments must be center stage in “correcting” the major environmental side effects of energy use is well established. This volume aims to help put this principle into practice by setting out a practicable methodology and associated tools for determining the right price. The book provides estimates, data permitting, for 156 cou ntries of the taxes on coal, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel needed to reflect environmental costs. Underpinning the policy recommendations is the notion that taxation (or tax-like instruments) can influence behavior; in much the same way that taxes on cigarettes discourage their overuse, appropriate taxes can discourage overuse of environmentally harmful energy sources.},

The efficient set of taxes includes charges on fuel use for carbon and local pollution (with credits for emissions capture during combustion) and additional charges on motor fuels for road congestion and accidents (though the latter should transition to distance-based charges). Techniques and data sources for measuring the externalities and corrective taxes by country are discussed. In general, heavy taxes on coal and motor fuels are warranted (though there is substantial cross-country variation in corrective tax rates). For most countries, tax reform could yield considerable fiscal, health, and carbon benefits.},

These initiatives include networks of cities committed to lowering their carbon footprints, voluntary corporate reduction targets and disclosure processes, and many of the rules that govern carbon markets. The paper considers the role of “traditional” actors in world politics—states and intergovernmental organizations—in orchestrating such initiatives. This strategy accounts for nearly a third of transnational climate governance initiatives, we find, and upends the conventional dichotomy between “top down” and “bottom up” solutions to global collective action problems. We develop a theory to explain when states and intergovernmental organizations are likely to engage in orchestration, and we provide initial support for this theory with a new dataset of transnational climate governance initiatives and case studies of two of the most active orchestrators, the World Bank and the United Kingdom.},

Currently, international trade offers trillions of dollars in incentives for countries to convert natural capital into marketable goods and services, and few payments to entice countries to conserve natural capital in order to sustain critical non-marketed ecosystem services. We examine the biophysical characteristics of climate change and biodiversity to understand the obstacles to developing effective IPES schemes.

To disburse funds, we should adapt Brazil's ICMS ecol{\'{o}}gico, and apportion available funds to targeted countries in proportion to how well they meet specific criteria designed to measure the provision of GES. Individual countries can then develop their own policies for increasing provision of these services, ensured of compensation if they do so. Indirect IPES should include funding for freely available technologies that protect or provide GES, such as the low carbon energy alternatives that will be essential for curbing climate change. Markets rely on the price mechanism to generate profits, which rations technology to those who can afford it, reducing adoption rates, innovation and total value. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The release of the long-awaited Green Paper by the Irish government opens an opportunity for a constructive dialogue and real debate on abortion. The rise in abortion cases in Ireland, from a previous 5336 cases to 5892 in 1998 has led the Irish government to draft the Green Paper to outline and analyze possible questions concerning abortion. Approaches ranged from the total restriction of abortion to an expanded right to abortion. It recognizes the complexity and ambiguity inherent in the abortion question. The challenge is now to harness this opportunity for debate and dialogue, because there are those who are seeking to use the same opening to promote intolerance, fear, and violence. There has been a dangerous increase in antiabortion extremism that coincides with the increasing ties between American and Irish antiabortion groups. Tony O' Brien, chief executive of the Irish Family Planning Association, however, assured that the Irish pro-choice movement is determined to prevent the Irish abortion debate from following the violent divisive road it has traveled in the US. It now aims to promote dialogue on the abortion issue, to encourage an honest understanding of the realities of abortion in Ireland, to legalize abortion in the country, and to address the much neglected problem of reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies.},

However the distribution of CDM projects has been extremely uneven across countries and regions, and a few technologies and sectors have dominated the early stages of CDM experience. This has caused some to question whether the CDM has fallen short of its potential in contributing to sustainable development. We review the broad patterns of CDM project approvals and evaluate 10 CDM projects according to their sustainability benefits. The difficulty of defining "sustainable development" and the process of defining criteria by individual non-Annex 1 governments has meant that sustainable development concerns have been marginalized in some countries. Given these observed limitations, we present possible CDM policy futures, focusing on the main proposals for a post-2012 climate regime. Five options for enhancing the sustainable development benefits in the CDM are discussed, including proactive approaches to favour eligibility of emission reduction projects which ensure such co-benefits. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In these three authoritative studies, payment for ecosystem services (PES) is listed as one of the mechanisms that should allow societies to pay for the maintenance of these services. Ecosystem services are receiving increased attention in the context of human development through The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity study (TEEB). This is an international initiative designed to call attention to the global economic benefits of biodiversity, and the growing costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. In TEEB s Report for Policymakers, PES schemes are listed as potentially useful mechanisms to compensate those who maintain the flow of ecosystem services. The study emphasizes that PES schemes offer considerable potential to raise new funds for biodiversity or to use existing funding more efficiently, and that both the public and private sectors can play a role in establishing PES in different contexts.},

The study focuses on developing an empirical and theoretical framework with which to model vehicle choice decisions under eco-labeled conditions. Particular attention is paid to how eco-information may affect the two-stage vehicle purchase process. The study builds upon environmental economic and psychology literature in examining the role of personal characteristics such as perceived effectiveness of consumer purchase decisions and perceptions of the eco-labeled products as factors in the vehicle purchase decision. It was found that environmental attributes of an eco-labeled passenger vehicle are significant in the purchase decision. The eco-information is considered in the vehicle purchase decision, but is generally not considered at the class-level decision.},

This paper considers the performance of eco-certification policy under circumstances where consumers cannot discern environmental attributes in goods, but are able to form rational expectations regarding the extent of illicit activities in the green market. The main results are: (i) fraud is less prevalent in green markets when entry barriers limit the number of firms; (ii) conventional environmental policies on polluting techniques increase the incidence of fraud, and can even preclude the use of non-polluting techniques which would otherwise emerge in green markets; (iii) voluntary eco-certification policies can decrease fraud, increase output, and raise profits per firm; and (iv) in cases where the socially optimal resource allocation can be supported, the optimal policy involves negative unit certification fees, positive fixed certification fees and is revenue-generating for the certifying agent.},

Faced with the minimum technology standard, firms make endogenous entry, certification, and price/quantity decisions. We consider both perfect and imperfect competition with or without sunk fixed costs. Our findings are as follows. Ecolabeling alone does not achieve the first-best outcome and, to achieve the second best, may need to set the standard less strict than the efficient level. Without sunk fixed costs, ecolabeling can achieve the first-best outcome provided that both the technology standard and the complementary pollution tax are set at efficient levels. With sunk fixed costs, however, differential excise taxes that would restore allocative efficiency induce more entry than optimal, and thus, can be even welfare decreasing relative to no tax outcome. Tightening the technology standard may ameliorate such an adverse effect of the corrective tax system by reducing excessive entry and pollution per output by the certified firms.},

The chapter provides an overview of taxation and other incentive-based regulations from an environmental law and economics perspective by addressing their strengths and weaknesses. Issues such as flexibility and cost-effectiveness, and also their susceptibility to lobbying at the legislative level and to regulate capture, are examined. The chapter shows that it is not surprising that there differing approaches since none of the policy instruments (taxes, contracts, liability rules, regulation or market-based instruments) may alone be optimal to provide adequate incentives for pollution control. A combination may be necessary, ideally making optimal use of the advantages of each particular policy instrument. To some extent, this can be observed in practice as well. The chapter also discusses the necessity to search for optimal instrument mixes and shows how those mixes of instruments are also applied in practice, especially in the European Union. However, using a behavioural approach, the chapter also shows some of the limits of instrument mixes.},

We find that, depending on whether programs are sponsored by industry, environmental groups, or a government, they have strikingly different incentives to grade or compete. Industry sponsors are indifferent about both; environmentalist sponsors optimally grade or compete with other environmentalist sponsors only if consumer preferences for green consumption are skewed in a specific way; and government sponsors׳ decisions depend on the relative importance of private vs. public benefits generated by the green market. We find also that it is no accident that green markets frequently have an environmentalist program competing with an industry one. For each of the cases examined, our analysis is consistent with casual empirical evidence.},

Further to the positive reception of this report, several countries requested UNEP to pro¬duce follow up reports focusing on specific adaptation gaps. In response to these requests, UNEP has commissioned a new report with a special focus on finance gaps and options to bridge them. The report will be published in the spring of 2016. This update is intended as an input to discussions at the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It brings together key findings on adaptation costs and finance from AGR 2014 and preliminary findings from the 2016 assessment. Furthermore, it draws on insights concerning adaptation costs and related finance needs, as stated in the adaptation components in the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) – the post-2020 climate actions that countries intend to undertake follow¬ing a new global agreement on climate change.},

The purpose of the current series of experiments was to examine some mechanisms and limits of this eco-label effect. In Experiment 1, an eco-label effect of similar magnitude was found for taste ratings of both conventional and organic bananas. Experiment 2 showed eco-label effects for a wider range of judgmental dimensions (i.e., health, calories, vitamins/minerals, mental performance, and willingness to pay) and the effect was about the same in magnitude for judgments of grapes and raisins. Experiment 3, with water as the tasted product, found no eco-label effect on judgments of taste, calories and vitamins/minerals, but an effect on willingness to pay, judgments of health benefits and judgments of mental performance benefits. Experiments 2 and 3 also included questionnaires on social desirability traits, schizotypal traits and pro-environmental consumer traits. The last was the strongest predictor of the eco-label effect amongst the three. In all, the eco-label effect is a robust phenomenon, but depends on interactions between product type and judgmental dimension. Implications for several accounts of the effect are discussed.},

abstract = {Indonesia has committed to reducing its emissions from land use, land use change and forestry - by 26% by 2020. One way the country plans to meet this target is by reducing its emissions from deforestation and forest degradation through the REDD+ mechanism. By implementing REDD+, Indonesia will become eligible to receive financial payments based on forest carbon credits. A substantial amount of Indonesia's carbon emissions are caused by deforestation and forest degradation from land conversion activities, forest fires and illegal logging, with the latter having significant impacts as a driver of deforestation. Therefore, initiatives to curb illegal logging will have to form a central part of any emission reduction strategy. REDD+ has the potential to help reduce illegal logging activities by creating financial incentives to encourage compliance with the law, changes in behaviour and wider governance reforms. Since 2001, several initiatives in Indonesia have attempted to address the problem of illegal logging. These include international initiatives such as the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) process; bilateral agreements between Indonesia and major importers of timber; and market instruments such as timber certification. National initiatives include joint security sweeps to combat illegal logging, anti-money laundering approaches to tackle illegal finance in the sector and the expansion of timber plantations to increase the supply of timber. This occasional paper explores ways in which the ongoing design of REDD+ mechanisms and institutions can benefit from these experiences.},

abstract = {The existing literature on eco-labeling and green consumerism has been framed within a classical market contextwhere price and quality are the drivers of consumer choice. However, it seems possible that consumers are also concerned about the choices made by other consumers. In fact, it is unclear that people's consumption decisions aremade indepen- dently of social context. For instance, under the desire to conform to certain social norms—or in the presence of status concerns—some individuals may be willing to pay a higher price premium for green products the more widespread green consumerism is in society.We test this hypothesis using a choice experiment where the respondentswere asked to choose among coffee products varying with respect to their share of ecological beans, share of fair trade beans, and price. Three treatments were used, differing only in the information given about the choices made by other consumers. We find different responses to the treatments across individuals andwe can only confirm our hypothesis of conformity forwomen, although men appear to have stronger preferences for ecological coffee than women have.},

abstract = {Eco-certified forestry (ECF) is defined as forest management that incorporates ecological concerns into commercial timber production. In this paper, we link the adoption of ECF practices to shifts in the timber supply function. We use a spatially disaggregated model of southeastern US timber supply to simulate the empirical relationship between variations in the price premium offered for timber produced under ECF regimes and producer surplus-maximizing rates of ECF. The simulation results suggest that a large share of nonindustrial private timber suppliers in the region may have relatively small compensation requirements, but complete adoption by the sector would require a large premium.},

This article provides a theoretical insight into this issue using a double differentiation framework. We assume that consumers perceive a label as a sign of quality compared to an unlabeled product, but that they cannot fully assess the environmental quality associated with each label and only see each label as a particular variety of a similar product. We analyze the pricing strategies of three firms, each one providing one product: a labeled product, with high or medium environmental quality, according to the eco-label, or an unlabeled product. We infer lessons for eco-labeling policies, according to the identity of the certifying organization: the regulator, an NGO or the firms. We show that the firm supplying the eco-labeled product with a high environmental quality is weakened by consumer confusion while the firm selling the unlabeled product suffers from strict labeling standards, to the benefit of the firm providing the labeled product with a lower environmental quality, which gains a competitive advantage. Most labeling policies consist of harmonizing labeling criteria, but only certification by a third party, the regulator or a NGO, guarantees the high environmental quality of labeled products, whereas certification by firms leads to a uniform undemanding standard. However, when both labels are provided by two different certifiers, including a firm, harmonization of environmental standards does not occur and the NGO's or regulator's eco-labeling standard will be much more stringent than the firm's one, preventing NGO's or public eco-labeling policy to significantly enhance quality of the environment and welfare.},

@article{Hansmann1991,
abstract = {In this Article, Professors Hansmann and Kraakman present a comprehensive case for imposing pro rata liability on shareholders for tort damages that exceed the value of a corporation's net assets. Unlimited liability, they argue, would mitigate the current regime's incentives to overinvest in hazardous industries and to underinvest in precautions. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, a well-crafted rule of unlimited liability could be imposed on both closely-held and publicly-traded corporations without inefficiently impairing capital formation. Rather, the most serious objections to unlimited liability are the difficulty of administering the rule across international jurisdictions, the incentive it would create to disaggregate industrial ownership, and the opportunity it might afford for irresponsible deployment of liability rules. None of these objections, however, seem sufficiently strong to outweigh the advantages of unlimited liability. The authors conclude that unlimited liability is also superior to alternative reforms such as liberalized veilpiercing, expanded officer and director liability, and requirements for minimal capitalization or insurance.},

abstract = {Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) has been proposed as an economic and extensive source of emission abatement to supplement other long-term climate policies. However, critics suggest an excess supply of REDD credits may disrupt emerging carbon markets and raise north-south equity concerns. In this context, we investigate the economic implications of REDD regulations and future emissions reduction commitments. Numerical model simulations show that unrestricted exchange of REDD units reduces the international carbon price by half and cuts compliance costs by roughly one-third. Developed nations' requirements for policy supplementarity, which restrict demand for REDD credits, reduce such price impacts but go at the expense of both economic efficiency and benefits to rainforest areas. Instead, unlimited REDD access facilitates climate policy targets to be tightened by almost a quarter at constant compliance cost, tripling the environmental ambition of the Kyoto Protocol and providing considerable wealth transfers to developing countries.

This is an issue because regulation involves limitations of freedom of activity in certain areas — often, but not only, areas of economic activity — that have a potentially large impact on the public interest or on the interests of particular individuals and enterprises. While regulatory activity is subject to a degree of judicial control and to various audits, it is widely recognized that regulators should also be under pressures that will ensure that their activities are carried out in the public interest and in a spirit of public service, and with due regard to the rights and interests of individuals and corporate bodies affected by the regulated activity — whether as operators or as consumers. The response to these concerns in the British system is found in a range of arrangements for what may be broadly called ‘democratic oversight'.},

abstract = {Following an abrupt fall in carbon credit prices, 2012 has witnessed a disinterest on behalf of investors in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). In this paper, we aim to take a step back and provide an assessment of the CDM through a careful analysis of 6 instrument evaluation criteria. Our study indicates that, despite the important number of projects developed under the CDM, the initial ambition of a scheme that would contribute to sustainable development in developing countries has not materialised. Moreover, the environmental integrity of numerous projects is seriously questioned. Given the interaction of the mechanism with other national policies, notably in the renewable sector, the search of carbon reduction opportunities does not lead to cost-effective abatements. If the CDM governance does not score really well in terms of predictability, the mechanism's transparency is an example for the development of future climate and development policies at a multilateral level. Finally, the lack of consideration for the demand side of the offset mechanism seriously jeopardises the persistence of this instrument. Therefore, we recommend that any CDM reform considers the demand side, for instance through the setting of a guaranteed minimum price coupled with an obligation of repurchase. One cannot expect progress in host countries if new sources of demand for carbon credits are not rapidly created in developed countries. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {The Coase Theorem and the vast literature it inspired explore two basic questions: to whom should responsibility for external harms be assigned and how will that assignment matter. Building on the Coasean insight in the torts context, Guido Calabresi observed that the assignment of tort liability can indeed matter from an efficiency perspective and should, under certain assumptions, be assigned to the "cheapest cost avoider." This article applies a similar Coasean/Calabresian framework to a related (though not identical) set of questions in the tax context: To whom should the responsibility for remitting taxes be assigned and when and how will that assignment matter? Following Calabresi's canonical formulation for the design of an optimal tort system, we conclude that an optimal tax remittance regime requires that tax liabilities be assigned so as to minimize the overall social costs of compliance and administration for a given level of achievement of the tax law's desired distributional and revenue goals. This will sometimes mean assigning tax remittance responsibility to the lowest-compliance-cost remitter, and other times not - if that party happens also to be the lowest-cost liability avoider (the party best able to evade the tax). This comparison of tax remittance responsibility and tort remittance responsibility produces a number of positive and normative insights. For example, it helps to explain why the remittance responsibility for the retail sales tax lies primarily with the sellers rather than the buyers, as well as why we have wage withholding for the income tax. And it helps to explain some existing types of non-wage withholding, such as withholding on payments to foreign taxpayers. This framework also supports a number of reforms in the current U.S. regime for tax enforcement such as expanding the withholding requirement to payments made to independent contractors, which are a type of payment that currently contributes significantly to the overall U.S. federal tax gap.},

abstract = {Forest conservation in one country can influence the degree of conservation or deforestation in other countries because of international linkages of the forest products industry and markets and a lack of global coordination. Thus leakage and offsetting losses of environmental quality may be present. This paper develops an analytical framework for measuring this leakage and estimates its magnitude via general equilibrium modeling. We find that the magnitude of leakage depends upon the price elasticities of supply of and demand for forestry products across the countries and degree of cooperation in forest conservation. We estimate that a significant portion (42%–95%) of the reduced forestry production implemented in a country/region can be transferred to elsewhere, offsetting environmental gains. Leakage generally diminishes as more countries cooperate, but cooperation among only a few countries does not always dramatically reduce leakage. Thus forest conservation efforts and associated environmental quantity gains in a country or group of countries can be seriously undermined in terms of global net conservation gain in the absence of effective global cooperation. Our results also point to the importance of taking leakage into account in evaluating local or regional forest carbon sequestration projects.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Forests worldwide bind CO2 and store it – so called Green carbon – and help mitigate climate change. However, deforestation accounts for an estimated 17 per cent of global carbon emissions: about 1.5 times greater than emissions from all the world's air, road, rail and shipping traffic combined. The vast majority of deforestation and illegal logging takes place in the tropical forests of the Amazon basin, Central Africa and Southeast Asia. Recent studies into the extent of illegal log- ging estimate that illegal logging accounts for 50–90 per cent of the volume of all forestry in key producer tropical countries and 15–30 per cent globally. Meanwhile, the economic value of global illegal logging, including processing, is estimated to be worth between US$ 30 and US$ 100 billion, or 10–30 per cent of global wood trade. A number of certification schemes and programmes have evolved to reduce illegal logging. These schemes, such as vol- untary trade agreements including the EU Forest Law Enforce- ment, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs), or Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification, have been successful in bringing stakeholders together and generating incentives for legal exports and more sustainable forestry. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is increasingly being used by states to ensure that trade in listed timber species is legal, sustainable and traceable. Around 350 tree species are now in- cluded in the three CITES Appendices, and trade in their prod- ucts is therefore subject to regulation to avoid utilization that is incompatible with their survival. CITES is also working with the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) to pro- mote sustainable forest management and to build the capacity of developing states to effectively implement the Convention as it relates to listed tree species. The main aim of the above mechanisms are to promote sus- tainable trade. With the exception of CITES, they were not designed to combat organized crime and are not effective in combating illegal logging, corruption and laundering of ille- gal timber in tropical regions. Other incentives and subsidies to offer alternative incomes are unlikely to be effective when illegal logging and laundering offer much higher profits and very low risk. Widespread collusive corruption from local of- ficials to the judiciary, combined with decentralized govern- ment structures in many tropical countries, provide little or no economic incentive for illegal loggers and corrupt officials to change their practices. To become effective, voluntary trade programmes and the ef- fective implementation of CITES, must be combined with an international law enforcement investigative and operational ef- fort in collaboration with domestic police and investigative task forces in each country. This is to ensure that a local decline in illegal logging is not offset by increases elsewhere, as interna- tional cartels move to new sources of illegal timber. In the last five years, illegal logging has moved from direct illegal logging to more advanced methods of concealment and timber laundering. In this report more than 30 ways of conducting illegal logging, laundering, selling and trading il- legal logs are described. Primary methods include falsifica- tion of logging permits, bribes to obtain logging permits (in some instances noted as US$ 20–50,000 per permit), logging beyond concessions, hacking government websites to obtain transport permits for higher volumes or transport, laundering},

abstract = {Confusion over how forces from beyond state borders affect domestic policy occurs because analysts often conflate different nondomestic factors, or focus on particular sources of influence to the exclusion of others. To remedy this problem, the authors make a distinction between the structural economic forces associated with rising levels of trade, finance and investment (globalization), and the increased activities or influence of transnational actors and international institutions, and the ideas they promote (internationalization). A focus on how transnational actors and international institutions influence domestic policy reveals four distinct pathways through which internationalization produces policy change-the use of markets, international rules, normative discourse and infiltration of domestic policy-making processes. The authors develop hypotheses to show the conditions under which influence is successfully achieved along each path. The case of ecoforestry policy change in the 1990s in Canada's Pacific Coast province, British Columbia, is used to illustrate the validity of the hypotheses. /// La fa{\~{A}}{\S}on dont les forces extra-territoriales influencent les politiques domestiques demeure confuse parce que, souvent, les sp{\~{A}}{\textcopyright}cialistes confondent des facteurs externes diff{\~{A}}{\textcopyright}rents ou restreignent leur investigation {\~{A}} certains d{\~{A}}{\textcopyright}terminants externes sp{\~{A}}{\textcopyright}cifiques.

The first section provides an introduction to ecosystem services and markets and payments for ecosystem services as well as a detailed review of basic PES types and concepts with examples. The second section informs about the potential PES deals offer to the poor population by reflecting opportunities and risks as well as ideal conditions for such schemes. The third section is the core part that includes a step-by-step approach for the development of PES deals, for identification of ecosystem service prospects and research potential buyers, assessment of institutional and technical capacity, structure of agreements, and implementation of PES agreements. The section is complemented by numerous case studies. The final section concludes on the importance of honest brokers for enabling pro-poor PES to reach those who most need it. Although the term ‘gender' is not explicitly mentioned in the document, gender can be seen as an element of ‘equity' which is a core issue being addressed throughout the document, that is mentioned for example in terms of equal distribution of revenues generated by PES, equal rights, adequate representation of community members in the management of community-based PES deals, etc.},

This review examines these schemes in the forest sector where, arguably, their development is among the most advanced of the sustainability labeling initiatives. Beginning with the origins, history, and features of schemes, the review synthesizes and assesses what we know about the direct effects and broader consequences of forest certification. Bearing in mind underlying factors affecting producers' decisions to certify, direct effects are examined by describing the uptake of schemes, the improvements to management of audited forests, and the ameliorative potential of certification for landscape-level concerns such as deforestation and forest protection. In assessing broader consequences, we look beyond the instrument itself to detail positive and negative unintended consequences, spillover effects, and longer-term and slow-moving effects that flow from the emergence of the certification innovation.},

abstract = {Since its inception nearly 15 years ago, environmental certification has become an important issue in the wood products industry. One research question that has been examined is the potential willingness for supply chain participants to pay a premium for certified products or raw materials to offset certification costs. This study examines stated willingness to pay for four wood products from the perspective of U.S. consumers. Data was collected in 1995 and 2005 from the population of U.S. residential consumers to detect changes in willingness to pay for certified wood products along time and increase the statistical strength of the model. Results of an ordered probit model suggest that higher probabilities of paying a premium are associated to consumers who seek out certified products and who believe certification can lessen environmental impacts such as tropical deforestation. There is also a strong relationship between respondent income and willingness-to-pay. Despite the current industry structure in the U.S. that has adopted a mass-certification strategy that does not place price premiums on certified products, results suggest that such premiums may exist for imported certified tropical wood products. Analysis of marginal effects suggests consumers' willingness to pay a 10% premium for three of the four certified items studied. Niche markets may potentially be exploited in the U.S. and price premiums captured by wood products manufacturers in tropical regions and/or American importers.},

abstract = {Are labels good or bad for consumers and firms? The answer may seem straightforward since labels improve information, yet economic theory reveals situations where their introduction reduces the welfare of at least some market participants. This essay reviews the theoretical literature on labels in order to identify and explain the main reasons that may cause labeling to produce undesirable side-effects. In contrast to earlier reviews that either concentrate on narrow topics or treat the subject in a more or less informal way, we bring together the main results from all the relevant topics by presenting and discussing the assumptions and model-building techniques that underpin them. The advantage of this approach is that it identifies the origin of the differences between results, thus allowing the synthesis of results that sometimes appear even to be contradictory. We focus on "quality labels" and examine the impact of labeling on market structure, the side-effects of costly certification, issues related to the label's trustworthiness, the rationale for mandatory vs. voluntary labeling, the level at which the label's standard is set according to the agency that selects it, the political economy of labels, that is, pro- or anti-label lobbying, lobbying to affect the label's standard, and lobbying in favor or against the label's mandatory imposition. These topics cover a wide range of applications, including Genetically Modified Organism (GMOs), organic produce, geographic indicators, controlled origin, eco-labels, etc. We conclude by identifying topics that require further research.},

abstract = {We investigate efficiency properties of binary ecolabels in a homogeneous good market with heterogeneous consumers. Faced with the minimum technology standard, firms make endogenous entry, certification, and price/quantity decisions. We consider both perfect and imperfect competition with or without sunk fixed costs. Our findings are as follows. Ecolabeling alone does not achieve the first-best outcome and, to achieve the second best, may need to set the standard less strict than the efficient level. Without sunk fixed costs, ecolabeling can achieve the first-best outcome provided that both the technology standard and the complementary pollution tax are set at efficient levels. With sunk fixed costs, however, differential excise taxes that would restore allocative efficiency induce more entry than optimal, and thus, can be even welfare decreasing relative to no tax outcome. Tightening the technology standard may ameliorate such an adverse effect of the corrective tax system by reducing excessive entry and pollution per output by the certified firms.},

The economic or utilitar- ian values of biodiversity rely upon the dependence of man on biodiversity; products that nature can provide: wood, food, fibers to make paper, resins, chemical organic products, genes as well as knowledge for biotechnology, including medicine and cosmetic sub-products. It also encompasses ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, reproduc- tive and feeding habitats for commercial fish, some organisms that can create soil fertility through complex cycles and interactions, such as earthworms, termites and bacteria, in addition to fungi responsible for cycling nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur and making them available to plant absorption. These services are the benefits that people indirectly receive from natural ecosystem functions (air quality maintenance, regional climate, water quality, nutrient cycling, reproductive habitats of commercial fish, etc.) with their related economic values.},

abstract = {This paper assesses quantification methods for carbon leakage from forestry activities for their suitability in leakage accounting in a future Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) mechanism. To that end, we first conducted a literature review to identify specific pre-requisites for leakage assessment in REDD. We then analyzed a total of 34 quantification methods for leakage emissions from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), the Climate Action Reserve (CAR), the CarbonFix Standard (CFS), and from scientific literature sources. We screened these methods for the leakage aspects they address in terms of leakage type, tools used for quantification and the geographical scale covered. Results show that leakage methods can be grouped into nine main methodological approaches, six of which could fulfill the recommended REDD leakage requirements if approaches for primary and secondary leakage are combined. The majority of methods assessed, address either primary or secondary leakage; the former mostly on a local or regional and the latter on national scale. The VCS is found to be the only carbon accounting standard at present to fulfill all leakage quantification requisites in REDD. However, a lack of accounting methods was identified for international leakage, which was addressed by only two methods, both from scientific literature.},

The study focuses on developing an empirical and theoretical framework with which to model vehicle choice decisions under eco-labeled conditions. Particular attention is paid to how eco-information may affect the two-stage vehicle purchase process. The study builds upon environmental economic and psychology literature in examining the role of personal characteristics such as perceived effectiveness of consumer purchase decisions and perceptions of the eco-labeled products as factors in the vehicle purchase decision. It was found that environmental attributes of an eco-labeled passenger vehicle are significant in the purchase decision. The eco-information is considered in the vehicle purchase decision, but is generally not considered at the class-level decision.},

abstract = {Are labels good or bad for consumers and firms? The answer may seem straightforward since labels improve information, yet economic theory reveals situations where their introduction reduces the welfare of at least some market participants. This essay reviews the theoretical literature on labels in order to identify and explain the main reasons that may cause labeling to produce undesirable side-effects. In contrast to earlier reviews that either concentrate on narrow topics or treat the subject in a more or less informal way, we bring together the main results from all the relevant topics by presenting and discussing the assumptions and model-building techniques that underpin them. The advantage of this approach is that it identifies the origin of the differences between results, thus allowing the synthesis of results that sometimes appear even to be contradictory. We focus on "quality labels" and examine the impact of labeling on market structure, the side-effects of costly certification, issues related to the label's trustworthiness, the rationale for mandatory vs. voluntary labeling, the level at which the label's standard is set according to the agency that selects it, the political economy of labels, that is, pro- or anti-label lobbying, lobbying to affect the label's standard, and lobbying in favor or against the label's mandatory imposition. These topics cover a wide range of applications, including Genetically Modified Organism (GMOs), organic produce, geographic indicators, controlled origin, eco-labels, etc. We conclude by identifying topics that require further research.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the development of certification programmes in three countries (Indonesia, Canada and Sweden) using the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) as a theoretical reference point. The ACF is an actor-based framework for analysing policy processes and has not previously been applied in a developing country. Actors in the three countries took different approaches to certification. In Canada, in a programme development process supported by the forest products industry, a management systems approach was taken. In Sweden, performance standards were developed in a process initially driven by NGOs. In Indonesia, certification was led by an NGO within a framework established by government, and a performance standards approach was used. The paper concludes that forest certification can be best understood as a policy instrument that promotes and facilitates policy-orientated learning among actors, and provides indirect incentives for improved forest management. Learning occurs both as the standards to be used for certification are developed, and as they are implemented. The benefits of learning and consensus building among actors (such as NGOs, forest companies, private forest owners, indigenous peoples, governments, etc.) who have traditionally been in conflict with each other can be significant. On the other hand, where fundamental changes in forest policy (such as tenure and forest revenue reform) are needed, certification should not be seen as a substitute for these A further conclusion is that, while public policies change over periods of decades, the private policies of retailers and forest product companies can adapt more rapidly to changing circumstances. The concept of a fast track of private policy change, compared to the slower track of governmental policy change, is therefore proposed and described. A number of interesting theoretical and empirical avenues for further research on certification are discussed.},

abstract = {The existing literature on eco-labeling and green consumerism has been framed within a classical market contextwhere price and quality are the drivers of consumer choice. However, it seems possible that consumers are also concerned about the choices made by other consumers. In fact, it is unclear that people's consumption decisions aremade indepen- dently of social context. For instance, under the desire to conform to certain social norms—or in the presence of status concerns—some individuals may be willing to pay a higher price premium for green products the more widespread green consumerism is in society.We test this hypothesis using a choice experiment where the respondentswere asked to choose among coffee products varying with respect to their share of ecological beans, share of fair trade beans, and price. Three treatments were used, differing only in the information given about the choices made by other consumers. We find different responses to the treatments across individuals andwe can only confirm our hypothesis of conformity forwomen, although men appear to have stronger preferences for ecological coffee than women have.},

abstract = {The long-term objective of the 2003 EU FLEGT Action Plan was to ensure a legal trade of timber products within and between countries and, by doing so, clear a pathway towards global sustainability and good governance. Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) between the EU and producing countries have emerged as a primary tool for achieving these goals. VPAs combine legality licensing as a market-based approach to stem illegal harvesting and trade with multi-stakeholder processes that seek to address underlying problems of forest governance, including unclear or contradictory forest related laws and weak community rights. We explore whether the EU FLEGT pathway from legality to sustainability is being laid down through VPAs by drawing on case studies of Ghana and Indonesia. These countries are among the first to agree VPAs and are currently working towards the issuance of FLEGT licenses for timber product exports to the EU. The paper uses a critical socio-legal approach that focuses not only on the negotiation of VPA text, but also on the implications of that text for how VPA policies will be interpreted, enacted and contested in their implementation. Our analysis indicates that both countries are adopting a uniform approach driven by the technical verification requirements needed to license timber for export. This overemphasis on timber licensing fails to address the leading role of the agricultural sector in driving forest loss, constrains civil society participation and creates disproportionate market barriers for local producers. We conclude that a more sustainable approach requires balancing trade-based licensing of large industry with other governance models more appropriate for small-scale operators and domestic markets. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {How are eco-label strategies affected by consumer confusion arising from the profusion of eco-labels? This article provides a theoretical insight into this issue using a double differentiation framework. We assume that consumers perceive a label as a sign of quality compared to an unlabeled product, but that they cannot fully assess the environmental quality associated with each label and only see each label as a particular variety of a similar product. We analyze the pricing strategies of three firms, each one providing one product: a labeled product, with high or medium environmental quality, according to the eco-label, or an unlabeled product. We infer lessons for eco-labeling policies, according to the identity of the certifying organization: the regulator, an NGO or the firms. We show that the firm supplying the eco-labeled product with a high environmental quality is weakened by consumer confusion while the firm selling the unlabeled product suffers from strict labeling standards, to the benefit of the firm providing the labeled product with a lower environmental quality, which gains a competitive advantage. Most labeling policies consist of harmonizing labeling criteria, but only certification by a third party, the regulator or a NGO, guarantees the high environmental quality of labeled products, whereas certification by firms leads to a uniform undemanding standard. However, when both labels are provided by two different certifiers, including a firm, harmonization of environmental standards does not occur and the NGO's or regulator's eco-labeling standard will be much more stringent than the firm's one, preventing NGO's or public eco-labeling policy to significantly enhance quality of the environment and welfare.},

The environmental economics approach to PES tries to force ecosystem services into the market model, with an emphasis on efficiency. The ecological economics approach, in contrast, seeks to adapt economic institutions to the physical characteristics of ecosystem services prioritizing ecological sustainability and just distribution and requiring a transdisciplinary approach. This paper summarizes the results of a participatory "atelier" workshop held in Costa Rica. We developed a set of principles (the Heredia Declaration) for PES systems and report on evolving initiatives in several countries. We discuss how the distinction between ecosystem goods (which are stock-flow resources) and ecosystem services (which are fund-service resources) and the physical characteristics of the fund-services affect the appropriate institutional form for PES. We conclude that PES systems represent an important way to effectively manage fund-service resources as public goods, and that this represents a significant departure from conventional market institutions. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

We review findings of PES impacts on forest cover, a proxy for forest-based ecosystem services. National studies conclude that PES has not lowered deforestation rates. Yet in northern Costa Rica, there is evidence of additionality for PES-related avoided deforestation. Moreover, sub-national studies of bi-directional forest cover change, along with farm-level interview data and an understanding of ground-based operations, demonstrate that avoided deforestation is an incomplete measure of PES impact. Sub-national case studies suggest PES is associated with agricultural abandonment and net gains in forest cover via forest regeneration and plantation establishment. Explanations include that forest regeneration has always been an accepted PES modality for some regions. Also, early PES cohorts have an implicit spatial correlation with pre-PES incentives focusing exclusively on reforestation. Without understanding de facto PES implementation, it is impossible to appropriately evaluate PES impacts or discern whether PES outcomes-positive or negative-are due to PES design or its implementation. This distinction is critical in refining our understanding of both the utility and limitations of PES and has some practical implications for PES-style REDD initiatives. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {Labels address a market failure—asymmetric information—through costly expenditures borne by consumers, firms, and taxpayers. In this review, we explore when mandatory and voluntary labeling policies may be socially optimal. Although the analysis ostensibly revolves around simple comparisons of labeling costs and the subsequent benefits from improved information symmetry, more symmetric information may alter social welfare in other ways, e.g., by altering the production of externalities, the exercise of market power, or expenditures on rent-seeking activities.We review work that contributes to a more complete analysis of the relative merits of mandatory and voluntary labeling; that assesses the distribution of welfare effects across affected groups; and that discusses political economy issues, particularly in the context of voluntary labels in international trade. We summarize key patterns of results concerning the relative desirability of mandatory and voluntary labels and discuss likely future directions...},

abstract = {How are eco-label strategies affected by consumer confusion arising from the profusion of eco-labels? This article provides a theoretical insight into this issue using a double differentiation framework. We assume that consumers perceive a label as a sign of quality compared to an unlabeled product, but that they cannot fully assess the environmental quality associated with each label and only see each label as a particular variety of a similar product. We analyze the pricing strategies of three firms, each one providing one product: a labeled product, with high or medium environmental quality, according to the eco-label, or an unlabeled product. We infer lessons for eco-labeling policies, according to the identity of the certifying organization: the regulator, an NGO or the firms. We show that the firm supplying the eco-labeled product with a high environmental quality is weakened by consumer confusion while the firm selling the unlabeled product suffers from strict labeling standards, to the benefit of the firm providing the labeled product with a lower environmental quality, which gains a competitive advantage. Most labeling policies consist of harmonizing labeling criteria, but only certification by a third party, the regulator or a NGO, guarantees the high environmental quality of labeled products, whereas certification by firms leads to a uniform undemanding standard. However, when both labels are provided by two different certifiers, including a firm, harmonization of environmental standards does not occur and the NGO's or regulator's eco-labeling standard will be much more stringent than the firm's one, preventing NGO's or public eco-labeling policy to significantly enhance quality of the environment and welfare.},

abstract = {Emission generated by the international merchant fleet has been suggested to represent a significant contribution to the global anthropogenic emissions. To analyze the impacts of these emissions, we present detailed model studies of the changes in atmospheric composition of pollutants and greenhouse compounds due to emissions from cargo and passenger ships in international trade. Global emission inventories of NOx, SO2, CO, CO2, and volatile organic compounds (VOC) are developed by a bottom-up approach combining ship-type specific engine emission modeling, oil cargo VOC vapor modeling, alternative global distribution methods, and ship operation data. Calculated bunker fuel consumption is found in agreement with international sales statistics. The Automated Mutual-assistance Vessel Rescue system (AMVER) data set is found to best reflect the distributions of cargo ships in international trade. A method based on the relative reporting frequency weighted by the ship size for each vessel type is recommended. We have exploited this modeled ship emissions inventory to estimate perturbations of the global distribution of ozone, methane, sulfate, and nitrogen compounds using a global 3-D chemical transport model with interactive ozone and sulfate chemistry. Ozone perturbations are highly nonlinear, being most efficient in regions of low background pollution. Different data sets (e.g., AMVER, The Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS)) lead to highly different regional perturbations. A maximum ozone perturbation of approximately 12 ppbv is obtained in the North Atlantic and in the North Pacific during summer months. Global average sulfate loading increases with 2.9%, while the increase is significantly larger over parts of western Europe (up to 8%). In contrast to the AMVER data, the COADS data give particularly large enhancements over the North Atlantic. Ship emissions reduce methane lifetime by approximately 5%. CO2 and O3 give positive radiative forcing (RF), and CH4 and sulfate give negative forcing. The total RF is small (0.01–0.02 W/m2) and connected with large uncertainties. Increase in acidification is 3–10% in certain coastal areas. The approach presented here is clearly useful for characterizing the present impact of ship emission and will be valuable for assessing the potential effect of various emission-control options.},

abstract = {Ship emissions are significantly increasing globally and have remarkable impact on air quality on sea and land. These emissions contribute serious adverse health and environmental effects. Territorial waters, inland seas and ports are the regions most affected by ship emissions. As an inland sea the Sea of Marmara is an area that has too much ship traffic. Since the region of the Marmara is highly urbanized, emissions from ships affect human health and the overall environment. In this paper exhaust gas emissions from ships in the Sea of Marmara and the Turkish Straits are calculated by utilizing the data acquired in 2003. Main engine types, fuel types, operations types, navigation times and speeds of vessels are taken into consideration in the study. Total emissions from ships in the study area were estimated as 5,451,224 t y- 1 for CO2, 111,039 t y- 1 for NOx, 87,168 t y- 1 for SO2, 20,281 t y- 1 for CO, 5801 t y- 1 for VOC, 4762 t y- 1 for PM. The shipping emissions in the region are equivalent to 11% of NOx 0.1% of CO and 0.12% of PM of the corresponding total emissions in Turkey. The shipping emissions in the area are 46% of NOx, 25% of PM and 1.5% of CO of road traffic emissions in Turkey data between which and correspond to a higher level than aircraft emissions and rail emissions in Turkey. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Combined, aviation and marine transportation are responsible for approximately 5 percent of total greenhouse (GHG) emissions in the United States and 3 percent globally and are among the fastest growing modes in the transportation sector. Controlling the growth in these emissions will be an important part of reducing emissions from the transportation sector. A range of near-, medium- and long-term mitigation options are available to slow the growth of energy consumption and GHG emissions from aviation and marine shipping. Implementation of these options could result in reductions of more than 50 percent below BAU levels by 2050 from global aviation and more than 60 percent for global marine shipping. For these reductions to be realized, however, international and domestic policy intervention is required. Developing an effective path forward that facilitates the adoption of meaningful policies remains both a challenge and an opportunity. “Aviation and Marine Transportation: GHG Mitigation Potential and Challenges” presents an introduction to aviation and marine transportation and a discussion of the determinants of GHG emissions from transportation; gives overview of current emissions and trends and growth projections; explains the technological mitigation options and potential GHG emission reductions; and discusses policy options at both the domestic and international level to achieve deep and durable reductions in emissions.},

abstract = {The purpose of the 'border tax adjustment' (BTA) mechanism is to neutralise the possible adverse effects caused by different national tax systems on international trade. When a government uses their national tax system for policy purposes in addition to the usual purpose to raise revenues, the differences between national tax systems are more obvious. Under such circumstances, the BTA mechanism is also adopted to address concerns about competitiveness arising from the different national tax systems. This includes the current debate on energy tax and carbon tax. As the need to tackle global warming increases, energy and carbon taxes are increasingly adopted as policy tools to control the emissions of greenhouse gases. Each domestic energy tax or carbon tax systems have different degrees of impact on the competitiveness of various industries. To address such competitiveness concerns, the current practices in several European countries give them the choice of granting various exceptions to certain energy intensive industries under the domestic energy tax system. Such exceptions, however, raise not only the question of fairness within the national tax system but also the environmental effectiveness of such an energy tax system. The BTA mechanism seems to be capable of providing an alternative to the abovementioned current practices to address concerns about competitiveness arising from different national energy and carbon tax systems. In dealing with this mechanism, the compatibility with the relevant BTA rules under the GATT/WTO must be considered. However, the main question this article seeks to answer is whether the relevant BTA rules under the GATT/WTO can provide a comprehensive legal framework to allow the BTA mechanism to be used as an effective tool to address the concerns about competitiveness.},

abstract = {Port and maritime studies dealing with containerization have observed traffic concentration and dispersion throughout the world. Globalization, intermodal transportation, and technological revolutions in the shipping industry have resulted in both network extension and rationalization. However, lack of precise data on inter-port relations prevent the application of wider network theories to global maritime container networks, which are often examined through case studies of specific firms or regions. In this article, we present an analysis of the global liner shipping network in 1996 and 2006, a period of rapid change in port hierarchies and liner service configurations. While we refer to literature on port system development, shipping networks, and port selection, the article is one of the only analyses of the properties of the global container shipping network. We analyse the relative position of ports in the global network through indicators of centrality. The results reveal a certain level of robustness in the global shipping network. While transhipment hub flows and gateway flows might slightly shift among nodes in the network, the network properties remain rather stable in terms of the main nodes polarizing the network and the overall structure of the system. In addition, mapping the changing centrality of ports confirms the impacts of global trade and logistics shifts on the port hierarchy and indicates that changes are predominantly geographic.},

Major shipping lines and strategic ports


a) There seem to be no strategic ports that can serve the EU that are located outside the EU.


b) The major shipping lines do serve different ports on their way to their port of destination. However, they do not appear to make considerable detours in order to call at a certain port. This is important as it decreases the possibility of discrimination against shipping lines that take the direct route to their port of destination instead of calling at other ports on their way.

The analysis confirms the strong influence of geography and distance on the distribution of traffic, showing the dominance of intraregional links and demonstrating good applicability of the gravity model for estimating inter-port traffic.

abstract = {The present era of globalization and regional competition has witnessed the increasing influence of the global operations of the shipping lines on port development and the declining monopoly of ports. This warrants the need for an identification of the port selection criteria from the perspective of the shipping lines. Hence, an attempt is made to determine the port choice from the perspective of the shipping lines. Moreover, most port operators have designed their strategies based on the ‘stated preference' of the shipping lines. However, the stated preference approach can have several shortcomings such as the shipping lines would tend to overstate their demands for services at the port. This directs for an examination of the port choice of the shipping lines based on a revealed preference approach. The ‘revealed preference' approach aims at judging the port choice of shipping lines purely from their ‘actions' rather than what they actually ‘state'. The empirical study in this article is based on a survey conducted among major shipping lines operating in Singapore and Malaysia. The findings have shown port charges and wide range of port services to be the only significant factors in their port choice. Moreover, the results show no consistency between the stated and revealed preferences of shipping lines.},

The scheme is comprehensive: it applies to EU and non- EU airlines (subject to a potential exemption), to passenger and cargo flights, and to flights between EU airports and between EU and non-EU airports. An airline that fails to surrender allowances is fined €100 per allowance and must make up the shortfall the following year. The EU's scheme has already given rise to legal action in connection with the EU's interna- tional civil aviation obligations. But, due to its impacts on trade in goods and services, the scheme also has implications for the EU's obligations under WTO law: specifically, under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Some of these issues are specific to this scheme, but in other respects they are connected with the current debate on the WTO legality of border carbon adjustments (BCAs). As this article shows, it is challenging to design a carbon scheme that is both admin- istratively feasible and justifiable under WTO law.},

abstract = {Regional and global air pollution from marine transportation is a growing concern. In discerning the sources of such pollution, researchers have become interested in tracking where along the total fuel life cycle these emissions occur. In addition, new efforts to introduce alternative fuels in marine vessels have raised questions about the energy use and environmental impacts of such fuels. To address these issues, this paper presents the Total Energy and Emissions Analysis for Marine Systems (TEAMS) model. TEAMS can be used to analyze total fuel life cycle emissions and energy use from marine vessels. TEAMS captures "well-to-hull" emissions, that is, emissions along the entire fuel pathway, including extraction, processing, distribution, and use in vessels. TEAMS conducts analyses for six fuel pathways: (1) petroleum to residual oil, (2) petroleum to conventional diesel, (3) petroleum to low-sulfur diesel, (4) natural gas to compressed natural gas, (5) natural gas to Fischer-Tropsch diesel, and (6) soybeans to biodiesel. TEAMS calculates total fuel-cycle emissions of three greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane) and five criteria pollutants (volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of 10 microm or less, and sulfur oxides). TEAMS also calculates total energy consumption, fossil fuel consumption, and petroleum consumption associated with each of its six fuel cycles. TEAMS can be used to study emissions from a variety of user-defined vessels. This paper presents TEAMS and provides example modeling results for three case studies using alternative fuels: a passenger ferry, a tanker vessel, and a container ship.},

abstract = {CO 2 emissions from international shipping, which are currently unregulated, are predicted to rise dramatically if no regulations are implemented. International bunker fuel emissions have been excluded from the Kyoto Protocol; the UNFCCC conference in Copenhagen also failed to bring about clear directions on how to proceed with these emissions. In this paper, the various options suggested by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice of the UNFCCC for allocating CO 2 emissions from international shipping to individual countries are investigated. This is followed by a discussion of the economic and regulatory issues related to these options and the consequences of applying them. Then, the various options are evaluated on the basis of environmental effectiveness, possibility of legal implementation, and fairness of burden sharing. The evaluation shows that there is no single allocation option that can be regarded as environmentally effective, legally effective and allowing for fair burden sharing. Nevertheless, it is concluded that an allocation of international shipping emissions should be conducted on the basis of the operating company.},

In the same Chapter, we also discuss the role of NT in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) from the perspective of economic theory. Having established the purpose of NT, we discuss in Chapter 3 the manner in which this provision has been implemented in case law: that is, here we focus on the understanding of the key terms implementing the purpose of NT by GATT and World Trade Organization (WTO) adjudicating bodies. At the end of this Chapter we provide a critical assessment of the case law. In light of our dissatisfaction with the case‐law interpretations of some key terms, we present in Chapter 4 our preferred interpretation of NT.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to provide the Hong Kong government with an alternative forecast of container throughput, by studying various interactive rela- tionships between major ports in East and Southeast Asia. As the demand for container handling services is `derived' fromthe demand for imports, the resulting market shares for the container handling services gripped by di{\OE} erent regions inevitably become a mirror image of the relative competitiveness of their exports. When the markets of the two ports overlap, their market shares will become a function of the prices they charge and how well they meet the needs of the shippers and shipping lines. A vector error correction model (VECM) with struc- tural identi{\textregistered} cation was set up to capture this kind of trade-interdependency and oligopolistic relationship in the East and Southeast Asian market for container handling services. In the course of so-doing, the upward sloping supply curves and downward sloping demand curve for the container handling services pro- vided by Hong Kong and Singapore are identi{\textregistered} ed from the model. Interestingly, the impulse response functions display what is reminiscent of the trade-interdependency and oligopolistic relationship. The forecast of Hong Kong container throughput generated by the structural VECM is then compared with that obtained by the Hong Kong Port Development Board (PDB). The sensitivity analysis shows that, in all possible cases, the structural VECM produces higher growth paths for the Hong Kong container throughput than the PDB does and, hence, suggests an earlier construction of new terminals. 1.},

abstract = {The transportation of cargos in containers has been intensively developing over the last decades. The world pace of growth in container transport is about 11% annually while in the Russian Federation from 2003 to 2007 the average growth was 21%. Container transportation is going to increase due to the construction of huge infrastructure projects for the Winter Olympics games in Sochi 2014, which implies the transportation of the required material flow. Foreign car assembly on Russian territory is developing, supplied by component parts delivered from Japan and the Republic of Korea, as well as from China that now bring 21.3% import container transport to Russia. About 60% of Russian container traffic passes through seaports Saint Petersburg, Novorossiysk and Vladivostok. The scenarios for increasing capacity to meet demands ahead are enhancing the productivity of seaports sites or leading to the creation of terminals in the hinterland. Although the phenomenon of dry ports is spread all over the world, in Russia none of the seaports has sufficient number of these facilities. The inland terminals of Russian seaports will be analysed from a dry port perspective. Despite the impediments, there are ecological and economical benefits that are discussed in the article. The advantages to the transport chain suggest that dry ports are a promising area for Russian seaports' welfare.},

abstract = {A reliable and up-to-date ship emission inventory is essential for atmospheric scientists quantifying the impact of shipping and for policy makers implementing regulations and incentives for emission reduction. The emission modelling in this study takes into account ship type and size dependent input data for 15 ship types and 7 size categories. Global port arrival and departure data for more than 32 000 merchant ships are used to establish operational profiles for the ship segments. The modelled total fuel consumption amounts to 217 Mt in 2004 of which 11 Mt is consumed in in-port operations. This is in agreement with international sales statistics. The modelled fuel consumption is applied to develop global emission inventories for CO2, NO 2, SO2, CO, CH4, VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds), N2O, BC (Black Carbon) and OC (Organic Carbon). The global emissions from ships at sea and in ports are distributed geographically, applying extended geographical data sets covering about 2 million global ship observations and global port data for 32 000 ships. In addition to inventories for the world fleet, inventories are produced separately for the three dominating ship types, using ship type specific emission modelling and traffic distributions. A global Chemical Transport Model (CTM) was used to calculate the environmental impacts of the emissions. We find that ship emissions is a dominant contributor over much of the world oceans to surface concentrations of NO2 and SO2. The contribution is also large over some coastal zones. For surface ozone the contribution is high over the oceans but clearly also of importance over Western North America (contribution 15-25%) and Western Europe (5-15%). The contribution to tropospheric column ozone is up to 5-6%. The overall impact of ship emissions on global methane lifetime is large due to the high NOx emissions. With regard to acidification we find that ships contribute 11% to nitrate wet deposition and 4.5% to sulphur wet deposition globally. In certain coastal regions the contributions may be in the range 15-50%. In general we find that ship emissions have a large impact on acidic deposition and surface ozone in Western North America, Scandinavia,Western Europe, western North Africa and Malaysia/Indonesia. For most of these regions container traffic, the largest emitter by ship type, has the largest impact. This is the case especially for the Pacific and the related container trade routes between Asia and North America. However, the contributions from bulk ships and tank vessels are also significant in the above mentioned impact regions. Though the total ship impact at low latitudes is lower, the tank vessels have a quite large contribution at low latitudes and near the Gulf of Mexico and Middle East. The bulk ships are characterized by large impact in Oceania compared to other ship types. In Scandinavia and north- Western Europe, one of the major ship impact regions, the three largest ship types have rather small relative contributions. The impact in this region is probably dominated by smaller ships operating closer to the coast. For emissions in ports impacts on NO2 and SO2 seem to be of significance. For most ports the contribution to the two components is in the range 0.5-5%, for a few ports it exceeds 10%. The approach presented provides an improvement in characterizing fleet operational patterns, and thereby ship emissions and impacts. Furthermore, the study shows where emission reductions can be applied to most effectively minimize the impacts by different ship types. 2009 Author(s).},

abstract = {The waterway network ship traffic, energy, and environment model (STEEM) is applied to geographically characterize energy use and emissions for interport ship movement for North America, including the United States, Canada, and Mexico. STEEM advances existing approaches by (i) estimating emissions for large regions on the basis of nearly complete data describing historical ship movements, attributes, and operating profiles of individual ships, (ii) solving distances on an empirical waterway network for each pair of ports considering ship draft and width constraints, and (iii) allocating emissions on the basis of the most probable routes. We estimate that the 172 000 ship voyages to and from North American ports in 2002 consumed about 47 million metric tonnes of heavy fuel oil and emitted about 2.4 million metric tonnes of SO2. Comparison with port and regional studies shows good agreement in total estimates and better spatial precision than current top-down methods. In quantifying limitations of top-down approaches that assume existing proxies for ship traffic density are spatially representative across larger domains, we find that International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) proxy data are spatially biased, especially at small scales. Emissions estimated by STEEM for ships within 200 nautical miles of the coastal areas of the United States are about 5 times the emissions estimated in previous studies using cargo as a proxy.},

abstract = {A method is presented for the evaluation of the exhaust emissions of marine traffic, based on the messages provided by the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which enable the identification and location determination of ships. The use of the AIS data facilitates the positioning of ship emissions with a high spatial resolution, which is limited only by the inaccuracies of the Global Positioning System (typically a few metres) that is used in vessel navigation. The emissions are computed based on the relationship of the instantaneous speed to the design speed, and the detailed technical information of the engines of the ships. The modelling of emissions is also based on a few basic principles of ship design, including the modelling of the propelling power of each vessel in terms of its speed. We have investigated the effect of waves on the consumption of fuel, and on the emissions to the atmosphere. The predictions of fuel consumption were compared with the actual values obtained from the shipowners. For a Roll on – Roll off cargo/passenger ship (RoPax), the predicted and reported values of annual fuel consumption agreed within an accuracy of 6%. According to the data analysis and model computations, the emissions of NOx, SOx and CO2 originating from ships in the Baltic Sea during the full calendar year of 2007 were in total 400 kt, 138 kt and 19 Mt, respectively. A breakdown of emissions by flag state, the type of ship and the year of construction is also presented. The modelling system can be used as a decision support tool in the case of issues concerning, e.g., the health effects caused by shipping emissions or the construction of emission-based fairway dues systems or emissions trading. The computation of emissions can be automated, which will save resources in constructing emission inventories. Both the methodologies and the emission computation program can be applied in any sea region in the world, provided that the AIS data from that specific region are available.},

abstract = {The regionalization model exemplified by the Northern Range ports in Europe has been devel- oped to such a degree that those ports now control most of the richest market regions of Europe. Their dominance of all but the southern and eastern fringes of the continent makes it very diffi- cult for ports in those regions to compete directly. The Mediterranean ports prior to the 1990s were largely bypassed by the ships engaged in the Asia-Europe trade. Over the last twenty years it has been common to see developments in container trade in the Mediterranean through the establishment of transshipment hubs, whose growth dwarfed the container traffic at the old hinterland ports in the Northern Mediterranean, and in many cases these hinterland ports were served by feeder services from the transshipment hubs. This model has served to describe con- tainer shipping in the Mediterranean, and with the addition of new transshipment hubs on the coast of North Africa, this view has been reinforced. This paper argues that that regionalization has been accompanied by a divergence making distinction between the gateway ports of the North and the transshipment hubs in the South is a gross oversimplification.},

abstract = {Marine vessel inventories demonstrate that ship emissions cannot be neglected in assessing environmental impacts of air pollution, although significant uncertainty in these inventories remains. We address this uncertainty by employing a bottom-up estimate of fuel consumption and vessel activity for internationally registered fleets, including cargo vessels, other commercial vessels, and military vessels.We identify model bias in previous work, which assumed internationally registered ships primarily consume international marine fuels. Updated results suggest fuel consumption is ?289 million metric tons per year, more than twice the quantity reported as international fuel. According to our analysis, fuel used by internationally registered fleets is apparently allocated to both international and domestic fuel statistics; this implies either that ships operate along domestic routes much of the time or that marine fuel sales to these ships may be misassigned. If the former is true, then allocation of emissions to international shipping routes may underestimate near-coastal emissions from ships. Our updated inventories increases previous ship emissions inventories for all pollutants; for example, global NOx emissions (?6.87 Tg N) are more than doubled. This work also produces detailed sensitivity analyses of inputs to these estimates, identifying uncertainty in vessel duty- cycle as critical to overall emissions estimates. We discuss implications for assessing ship emissions impacts. I},

abstract = {The evolution of the law of the sea has been shaped largely by two notions, namely, freedom of navigation on the one hand, and restricted access on the other hand. The interaction between these two opposing notions has led to the acceptance of two compromise concepts, namely, the territorial sea and the right of innocent passage. These concepts have now been codified in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This paper examines the right of innocent passage in the territorial sea under the Law of the Sea Convention regime as matched against contemporary state practice. It would appear that many coastal states prefer the restriction of this right – seemingly infringing what the Convention stands for. It is submitted that states should restructure their policies and regulations to conform to their assumed obligations under the Convention.},

These methods are not easily compared due to their analysis of different contexts and their underlying different assumptions. The estimates of the International Maritime Organization in confirmed some of the results in the literature, but the debate is ongoing. In this manuscript, factors from nine methods that have been applied for the evaluation of fuel consumption and emissions are studied and compared. The review and application of these maritime emission inventories reveal no significant differences between these methods. Regarding the total pollutant values, the largest differences correspond to the application of the factors employed by the International Maritime Organization for main engines, and the smallest differences correspond to the application of the factors employed by the Environmental International Corporation for auxiliary engines. The recommendations made in this manuscript include the use of the STEAM (ship traffic emission assessment model) method, the use of the method developed by Goldsworthy to apply the emission factors and the consideration of the maintenance state of the engines as an additional uncertainty factor. The analysis made in this manuscript shows more possibly detailed methods that can substantially improve the quality of bottom-up inventory estimates.},

abstract = {Emission generated by the international merchant fleet has been suggested to represent a significant contribution to the global anthropogenic emissions. To analyze the impacts of these emissions, we present detailed model studies of the changes in atmospheric composition of pollutants and greenhouse compounds due to emissions from cargo and passenger ships in international trade. Global emission inventories of NOx, SO2, CO, CO2, and volatile organic compounds (VOC) are developed by a bottom-up approach combining ship-type specific engine emission modeling, oil cargo VOC vapor modeling, alternative global distribution methods, and ship operation data. Calculated bunker fuel consumption is found in agreement with international sales statistics. The Automated Mutual-assistance Vessel Rescue system (AMVER) data set is found to best reflect the distributions of cargo ships in international trade. A method based on the relative reporting frequency weighted by the ship size for each vessel type is recommended. We have exploited this modeled ship emissions inventory to estimate perturbations of the global distribution of ozone, methane, sulfate, and nitrogen compounds using a global 3-D chemical transport model with interactive ozone and sulfate chemistry. Ozone perturbations are highly nonlinear, being most efficient in regions of low background pollution. Different data sets (e.g., AMVER, The Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS)) lead to highly different regional perturbations. A maximum ozone perturbation of approximately 12 ppbv is obtained in the North Atlantic and in the North Pacific during summer months. Global average sulfate loading increases with 2.9%, while the increase is significantly larger over parts of western Europe (up to 8%). In contrast to the AMVER data, the COADS data give particularly large enhancements over the North Atlantic. Ship emissions reduce methane lifetime by approximately 5%. CO2 and O3 give positive radiative forcing (RF), and CH4 and sulfate give negative forcing. The total RF is small (0.01–0.02 W/m2) and connected with large uncertainties. Increase in acidification is 3–10% in certain coastal areas. The approach presented here is clearly useful for characterizing the present impact of ship emission and will be valuable for assessing the potential effect of various emission-control options.},

abstract = {Seagoing ships emit exhaust gases and particles into the marine boundary layer and significantly contribute to the total budget of anthropogenic emissions. We present an emission inventory for international shipping for the past five decades to be used in global modeling studies with detailed tropospheric chemistry. The inventory is a bottom-up analysis using fuel consumption and fleet numbers for the total civilian and military fleet including auxiliary engines at the end of 2001. Trend estimates for fuel mass, CO2, NOx, and other emissions for the time between 1950 and 2001 have been calculated using ship number statistics and average engine statistics. Our estimate for total fuel consumption and global emissions for the year 2001 is similar to previous activity-based studies. However, compared to earlier studies, a detailed speciation of nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and particulate matter is given, and carbon monoxide emissions are calculated explicitly. Our results suggest a fuel consumption of approximately 280 million metric tons (Mt) for the year 2001 and 64.5 Mt in 1950. This corresponds to 187 (5.4) Tg CO2 (NOx) in 1950, and 813 (21.4) Tg CO2 (NOx) in 2001. From 1970 to 2001 the world-merchant fleet increased rapidly in terms of ship numbers, with a corresponding increase in total fuel consumption. The fuel consumption estimates are compared against historical marine bunker fuel statistics, and our emission estimates are related to emission budgets of other transport modes. Global ship emissions are distributed geographically according to global vessel traffic densities of the AMVER (Automated Mutual-assistance Vessel Rescue system) data set for the year 2000. This work also sets the basis to develop future emission scenarios based on average-fleet emission indices in part 2 of this study.},

abstract = {This analysis seeks to evaluate the influence of emission source location on population exposure in China to fine particles and sulfur dioxide. We use the concept of intake fraction, defined as the fraction of material or its precursor released from a source that is eventually inhaled or ingested by a population. We select 29 power-plant sites throughout China and estimate annual average intake fractions at each site, using identical source characteristics to isolate the influence of geographic location. In addition, we develop regression models to interpret the intake fraction values and allow for extrapolation to other sites. To model the concentration increase due to emissions from selected power plants, we used a detailed long-range atmospheric dispersion model, CALPUFF. Primary fine particles have the highest average intake fraction (1 x 0(-5)), followed by sulfur dioxide (5 x 10(-6)), sulfate from sulfur dioxide (4 x 10(-6)), and nitrate from nitrogen oxides (4 x 10(-6)). For all pollutants, the intake fractions span approximately an order of magnitude across sites. In the regression analysis, the independent variables are meteorological proxies (such as climate region and precipitation) and population at various distances from the source. We find that population terms can explain a substantial percentage of variability in the intake fraction for all pollutants (R(2) between 0.86 and 0.95 across pollutants), with a significant modifying influence of meteorological regime. Near-source population is more important for primary coarse particles while population at medium to long distance is more important for primary fine particles and secondary particles. A significant portion of intake fraction (especially for secondary particles and primary fine particles) occurs beyond 500 km of the source, emphasizing the need for detailed long-range dispersion modeling. These findings demonstrate that intake fractions for power plants in China can be estimated with reasonable precision and summarized using simple regression models. The results should be useful for informing future decisions about power-plant locations and controls.},

abstract = {T The large-scale movement offreight by road in Europe has contributed to worsening trajic congestion and deteriorating transport conditions generally. A number of policy initiatives have sought to address this problem by encouraging the use of rail or sea transport, especially over longer distances. A freight transport cost model, applicable to any given route over which freight is moved by a variety of means, is proposed. The model enables the logistics tradeoffs, such as those between speed and costs, to be thoroughly examined in a range of circumstances. In particular, the model highlights the factors which affect the choice of transport mode or combination of modes for given movements. By testing the model against real conditions on the UK-Greece transport corridor, it is showtz to be robust and to contribute positively to the wider debate on modal choiceforfreight transport at large. The model may also be used in the process of transport policy formulation.},

While environmental taxes efficiencies have previously been discussed, those taxes contribution to reducing pollution and improving environmental quality has not been fully explored.

Using a cross-section regression and a panel dynamic regression, the paper finds that countries with higher revenues from these types of taxes also exhibit higher reductions in CO2 emission, PM10 emissions, and energy consumption and produc- tion from fossil sources.},

abstract = {Development and changes in port hinterlands have received considerable attention as they represent substantial opportunities to improve the efficiency of global freight distributions. Port regionalization was a concept brought forward by Notteboom and Rodrigue (2005) to articulate the emerging port hinterland dynamics in light of containerization, supply chain management and the setting of inland terminals. This paper expands this concept by focusing on a particular dimension of the regionalization paradigm concerning the evolving role of intermediate hubs. It is argued that, in addition to hinterland- based regionalization, there is also a foreland-based regionalization where intermediate hubs capture a maritime hinterland. This intensity and viability of processes of foreland-based regionalization depend on multiple geographical, technical and market-related factors, and this paper identifies and analyzes these underlying parameters. By doing so, it assesses whether foreland-based regionalization is simply a transitional phase in port development or, alternatively, represents emerging functional characteristics of contemporary freight distributions.},

abstract = {We examine an implication of the “Coase Theorem” which has had an important impact both on environmental economics and on public policy in the environmental domain. Under certain conditions, the market equilibrium in a cap-and-trade system will be cost-effective and independent of the initial allocation of tradable rights. That is, the overall cost of achieving a given aggregate emission reduction will be minimized, and the final allocation of permits will be independent of the initial allocation. We call this the independence property. This property is very important because it allows equity and efficiency concerns to be separated in a relatively straightforward manner. In particular, the property means that the government can establish the overall pollution-reduction goal for a cap-and-trade system by setting the cap, and leave it up to the legislature – such as the U.S. Congress – to construct a constituency in support of the program by allocating the allowances to various interests without affecting either the environmental performance of the system or its aggregate social costs. Our primary objective in this paper is to examine the conditions under which the independence property is likely to hold – both in theory and in practice. A number of factors can call the independence property into question theoretically, including market power, transaction costs, non-cost-minimizing behavior, and conditional allowance allocations. We find that, in practice, there is support for the independence property in some, but not all cap-and-trade applications.},

This paper analyses in-depth the limits and opportunities of policy options currently under consideration at the international level to stimulate the sector to reduce its GHG emissions. In particular, in order for the maritime transport sector to become more environmentally friendly, the flexible nature of international market-based measures and the European Union Emission Trading Scheme provide a definite window of opportunity without placing unnecessary high burden on the sector. However, the development of a regional policy, such as at European level, for the international maritime transport sector faces several obstacles: allocation of emissions, carbon leakage, permit allocation, treatment of the great variety in ship type, size and usage, and transaction cost. Global market-based policies could overcome most of these challenges. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the policy instruments currently under discussion to reduce the sector's burden on the environment, and focuses on economic theory, legal principles, technological options, and the political framework that together make up the basis of decision-making regarding the international maritime transport sector's climate change policies.},

abstract = {Endogenous demand responses for energy services, resulting from changing prices, have long been characterised in energy systems models. However, the uncertainty associated with such demand responses, modelled through the use of price elasticities, has often been ignored. This is problematic for two key reasons – elasticity factors used in models are highly uncertain due to the limited evidence base, while at the same time, demand response has been observed as a critical mechanism for meeting long term climate mitigation targets. This paper makes two important contributions for improving the understanding of the role of price-induced demand response. Firstly, it attempts to address the problem of unsatisfactory elasticity input assumptions by undertaking an up-to-date review of the literature. Secondly, the role of demand response under uncertainty is assessed using a probabilistic approach, focusing on its contribution to mitigation. The paper highlights that demand response does play a critical role in mitigation, ensuring a more cost-effective transition to a low carbon energy system. Crucially, the uncertainties associated with price elasticities do not weaken this finding. The transport sector is the driver of this demand response leading to important implications for policy and the focus of demand side interventions.},

abstract = {[1] Shipping activity has increased considerably over the last century and currently represents a significant contribution to the global emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. Despite this, information about the historical development of fuel consumption and emissions is generally limited, with little data published pre-1950 and large deviations reported for estimates covering the last 3 decades. To better understand the historical development in ship emissions and the uncertainties associated with the estimates, we present fuel-based CO2 and SO2 emission inventories from 1925 up to 2002 and activity-based estimates from 1970 up to 2000. The global CO2 emissions from ships in 1925 have been estimated to 229 Tg (CO2), growing to about 634 Tg (CO2) in 2002. The corresponding SO2 emissions are about 2.5 Tg (SO2) and 8.5 Tg (SO2), respectively. Our activity-based estimates of fuel consumption from 1970 to 2000, covering all oceangoing civil ships above or equal to 100 gross tonnage (GT), are lower compared to previous activity-based studies. We have applied a more detailed model approach, which includes variation in the demand for sea transport, as well as operational and technological changes of the past. This study concludes that the main reason for the large deviations found in reported inventories is the applied number of days at sea. Moreover, our modeling indicates that the ship size and the degree of utilization of the fleet, combined with the shift to diesel engines, have been the major factors determining yearly fuel consumption. Interestingly, the model results from around 1973 suggest that the fleet growth is not necessarily followed by increased fuel consumption, as technical and operational characteristics have changed. Results from this study indicate that reported sales over the last 3 decades seems not to be significantly underreported as previous simplified activity-based studies have suggested. The results confirm our previously reported modeling estimates for year 2000. Previous activity-based studies have not considered ships less than 100 GT (e.g., today some 1.3 million fishing vessels), and we suggest that this fleet could account for an important part of the total fuel consumption (∼10%)},

In this context, attention is given to the relation between intra-port and inter-port competition. Third, the paper examines the conditions under which these arguments are valid and intra-port competition can be introduced. Possible policy responses to limited or absent intra-port competition are discussed in this section as well. Fourth, the need to introduce effects of intra-port competition in port modelling is briefly. Finally, the paper presents empirical evidence of the effects of intra-port competition.},

abstract = {The lack of real progress at the Durban climate change conference in 2011— postponing effective action until at least 2020—has many causes, one of which is the failure to address trade issues and in particular carbon leakage. This paper advances two arguments. First, it argues that the conventional view of Border Carbon Adjustments (BCAs) as a “dirty” trade barrier should be turned on its head. Rather, the absence of a carbon price comprises an implicit subsidy to dirtier production in non-regulated markets. Second, BCAs could act as a game- changer when climate policy negotiations move at a glacial pace, if at all. Materially stronger progress could be achieved indirectly from the threat of unilateral trade policies. The paper shows how this could come about, using a simple political game theory model. The appropriate game form is one in which parties move unilaterally and sequentially, given the failure to agree on a common course of action, and are fully aware of the impacts of their actions. The paper shows that properly crafted BCAs could help reduce trade distortions, limit the competiveness effects, and help build a broader coalition of interests for more global actions.},

Isolating ports of comparable size reveals hidden substructures with the help of graph visualization.

abstract = {abstract Emissions of exhaust gases and particles from oceangoing ships are a significant and growing contributor to the total emissions from the transportation sector. We present an assessment of the contribution of gaseous and particulate emissions from oceangoing shipping to anthropogenic emissions and air quality. We also assess the degradation in human health and climate change created by these emissions. Regulating ship emissions requires comprehensive knowledge of current fuel consumption and emis- sions, understanding of their impact on atmospheric composition and climate, and projections of potential future evolutions and mitigation options. Nearly 70% of ship emissions occur within 400 km of coastlines, causing air quality problems through the formation of ground-level ozone, sulphur emissions and particulate matter in coastal areas and harbours with heavy traffic. Furthermore, ozone and aerosol precursor emissions as well as their derivative species from ships may be transported in the atmosphere over several hundreds of kilometres, and thus contribute to air quality problems further inland, even though they are emitted at sea. In addition, ship emissions impact climate. Recent studies indicate that the cooling due to altered clouds far outweighs the warming effects from greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or ozone from shipping, overall causing a negative present-day radiative forcing (RF). Current efforts to reduce sulphur and other pollutants from shipping may modify this. However, given the short residence time of sulphate compared to CO2, the climate response from sulphate is of the order decades while that of CO2 is centuries. The climatic trade-off between positive and negative radiative forcing is still a topic of scientific research, but from what is currently known, a simple cancellation of global mean forcing components is potentially inappropriate and a more comprehensive assessment metric is required. The CO2 equivalent emissions using the global temperature change potential (GTP) metric indicate that after 50 years the net global mean effect of current emissions is close to zero through cancellation of warming by CO2 and cooling by sulphate and nitrogen oxides.},

They also carry significant impact on the economies of the neighbouring countries – Russia shares borders with 16 countries. During the last decade Russia has become quite important player on the transportation market: exporting, importing and transiting goods and commodities in rather consider- able volumes. Although, the country's transportation sector is well developed, it is still quite far from being flawless and there is a lot of room for potential improvement. In order to meet the requirements of the international standards, Russian government is constantly developing new strategies. The objective of proper strategizing is to set op- timal course for further development of the sector. Strategizing is especially crucial in the environment of the global financial crisis, which had a rather dramatic effect on both Russian port and railway sectors. During the recession cargo turnover of certain com- modity groups in ports and on railways dropped drastically consequently slowing the development processes in both sectors and affecting the economy of the whole country. Today it seems that the worst part of the recession is somewhat behind and the world's economy is slowly getting back on its feet. The Russian port and railway sectors are also showing certain signs of rejuvenation. It would be interesting to follow how the situation around those sectors develops and what further impacts it has on the areas that are under the sphere of influence of those two sectors.},

abstract = {A method is presented for the evaluation of the exhaust emissions of marine traffic, based on the messages provided by the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which enable the positioning of ship emissions with a high spatial resolution (typically a few metres). The model also takes into account the detailed technical data of each individual vessel. The previously developed model was applicable for evaluating the emissions of NOx, SO x and CO2. This paper addresses a substantial extension of the modelling system, to allow also for the mass-based emissions of particulate matter (PM) and carbon monoxide (CO). The presented Ship Traffic Emissions Assessment Model (STEAM2) allows for the influences of accurate travel routes and ship speed, engine load, fuel sulphur content, multiengine setups, abatement methods and waves. We address in particular the modeling of the influence on the emissions of both engine load and the sulphur content of the fuel. The presented methodology can be used to evaluate the total PM emissions, and those of organic carbon, elemental carbon, ash and hydrated sulphate. We have evaluated the performance of the extended model against available experimental data on engine power, fuel consumption and the composition-resolved emissions of PM. As example results, the geographical distributions of the emissions of PM and CO are presented for the marine regions surrounding the Danish Straits. Author(s) 2011.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to estimate the atmospheric emissions by international merchant shipping of carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) during 1 year in the Belgian part of the North Sea, including the four Belgian seaports: Antwerp, Ghent, Ostend and Zeebrugge. The estimated emissions are based on a bottom-up, activity-based methodology (Group 1), covering more than 90% of shipping activity, complemented with a top-down fuel consumption methodology for the remaining activities. In total, an estimate of 1880 kton CO2, 31 kton SO2 and 39 kton NOX is emitted over the period April 2003 until March 2004. Compared to national inventories (2003 data) this accounts to 1.5% for CO2, 30% for SO2 and 22% for NOX of total emissions of these gases in Belgium. When the CO2 figure is compared with the current estimate of CO2 emissions from international shipping, based on sold bunker fuels (22 754 kton CO2), the relevance of a detailed and precise emission inventory becomes clear. In the end, the Belgian estimates are validated by comparing them with Dutch, EU and international emission estimates. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Corbett2008,
abstract = {Worldwide concerns about sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions from ships are motivating the replacement of marine residual oil (RO) with cleaner, lower-sulfur fuels, such as marine gas oil (MGO) and marine diesel oil (MDO). Vessel operators can use MGO and MDO directly or blended with RO to achieve environmental and economic objectives. Although expected to be much cleaner in terms of criteria pollutants, these fuels require additional energy in the upstream stages of the fuel cycle (i.e., fuel processing and refining), and thus raise questions about the net impacts on greenhouse gas emissions (primarily carbon dioxide [CO2]) because of production and use. This paper applies the Total Energy and Environmental Analysis for Marine Systems (TEAMS) model to conduct a total fuel cycle analysis of RO, MGO, MDO, and associated blends for a typical container ship. MGO and MDO blends achieve significant (70–85%) SOx emissions reductions compared with RO across a range of fuel quality and refining efficiency assumptions. We estimate CO2 increases of less than 1% using best estimates of fuel quality and refinery efficiency parameters and demonstrate how these results vary based on parameter assumptions. Our analysis suggests that product refining efficiency influences the CO2 tradeoff more than differences in the physical and energy parameters of the alternative fuels, suggesting that modest increases in CO2 could be offset by efficiency improvements at some refineries. Our results help resolve conflicting estimates of greenhouse gas tradeoffs associated with fuel switching and other emissions control policies.},

abstract = {This study addresses the exhaust emissions of CO₂, NO(x), SO(x), CO, and PM(2.5) originated from Baltic Sea shipping in 2006-2009. Numerical results have been computed using the Ship Traffic Emissions Assessment Model. This model is based on the messages of the automatic identification system (AIS), which enable the positioning of ships with a high spatial resolution. The NO(x) emissions in 2009 were approximately 7 % higher than in 2006, despite the economic recession. However, the SO(x) emissions in 2009 were approximately 14 % lower, when compared to those in 2006, mainly caused by the fuel requirements of the SO(x) emission control area (SECA) which became effective in May 2006, but affected also by changes in ship activity. Results are presented on the differential geographic distribution of shipping emissions before (Jan-April 2006) and after (Jan-April 2009) the SECA regulations. The predicted NO(x) emissions in 2009 substantially exceeded the emissions in 2006 along major ship routes and at numerous harbors, mostly due to the continuous increase in the number of small vessels that use AIS transmitters. Although the SO(x) emissions have been reduced in 2009 in most major ship routes, these have increased in the vicinity of some harbors and on some densely trafficked routes. A seasonal variation of emissions is also presented, as well as the distribution of emissions in terms of vessel flag state, type, and weight.},

abstract = {Shipping emissions are currently increasing and will most likely continue to do so in the future due to the increase of global-scale trade. Ship emissions have the potential to contribute to air quality degradation in coastal areas, in addition to contributing to global air pollution. With the aim to quantify the impacts of shipping emissions on urban air quality in coastal areas in Europe, an in depth literature review was carried out focussing on particulate matter and gaseous pollutants but also reviewing the main chemical tracers of shipping emissions, the particle size distribution of ship-derived particulates and their contributions to population exposure and atmospheric deposition. Mitigation strategies were also addressed. In European coastal areas, shipping emissions contribute with 1-7% of ambient air PM10 levels, 1-14% of PM2.5, and at least 11% of PM1. Contributions from shipping to ambient NO2 levels range between 7 and 24%, with the highest values being recorded in the Netherlands and Denmark. Impacts from shipping emissions on SO2 concentrations were reported for Sweden and Spain. Shipping emissions impact not only the levels and composition of particulate and gaseous pollutants, but may also enhance new particle formation processes in urban areas. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {The worldwide network of container transport services, both on land and at sea, is becoming increasingly fine-meshed. The growth in the number of intermodal transfer points on the land side, at the sea–land interface in the seaports and at the connecting points of liner services in transhipment ports leads to an increasing number of routing options for a container flow between two regions somewhere on the globe. This increase complicates forecasting the container throughput of a port in the traditional way by linking it directly to a specific hinterland area. In the approach presented here, a port is considered as a nodal point in a network of container routings, where the routings using a certain port add up to the port's container throughput. The model presented here is intended to explain the market share of the port's routings for each of the traffic zones or regions that comprise a port's potential hinterland. Explanatory variables include transport cost, transit time, frequency of service and indicators of quality of service. A logit model is used to quantify the routing choice and to derive from that a demand function to be used for port traffic forecasting and for the economic and financial evaluation of container port projects. The authors had the opportunity to calibrate logit models in the framework of the evaluation of the Maasvlakte-2 container port expansion project in the port of Rotterdam.},

The analysis is primarily focused on the UK, but is international in application. The paper is based on both the analysis of secondary data and information on actions taken by ports to reduce their emissions, with the latter data collected for the main UK ports via their published reports and/or via interviews. Only a small number of ports (representing 32% of UK port activity) actually measure and report their carbon emissions in the UK context. The emissions generated by ships calling at these ports are analysed using a method based on Department for Transport Maritime Statistics Data. In addition, a case example (Felixstowe) of emissions associated with HGV movements to and from ports is presented, and data on vessel emissions at berth are also considered.Our analyses indicate that emissions generated by ships during their voyages between ports are of a far greater magnitude than those generated by the port activities. Thus while reducing the ports' own emissions is worthwhile, the results suggest that ports might have more impact through focusing their efforts on reducing shipping emissions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

E-mail: LirnTC@Cardiff.ac.uk The research presented in this paper applies the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to reveal and analyse transhipment port selection by global carriers. In all, 47 relevant service attributes were recorded from a literature review. Two rounds of Delphi surveys – followed by brainstorming sessions – were conducted among experts in industry and academia, in order to narrow their number to four main service attributes/criteria comprising 12 sub-criteria. An AHP designed questionnaire survey was distributed to 20 port users, which covered the total population of global ocean container operators, and to 20 transhipment service providers (port operators/authorities). The results of the AHP analysis revealed that both global container carriers and port service providers had a similar perception of the most important service attributes for transhipment port selection. However, the AHP weight ranking of the sub- criteria involved was not identical between the two surveys, providing scope for further adaptation of service providers to users' priorities. Differences in the performance ranking of six major container ports by global carriers, as revealed in the AHP survey, were then combined with the calculated weights for the 12 transhipment port selection sub-criteria to explore critical attributes where transhipment market strategy could focus.},

abstract = {Emissions from ships have recently received more attention since they have become a significant concern for air quality in harbours and port cities. This paper presents the methodology for a comprehensive maritime transport database of activity data, specific energy consumption, emission factors, and total emissions that have been developed within the European EX-TREMIS project. The model is built upon 3 modules: the fleet module, the transport activity module, and the emission module. The fleet module defines the ship categories, the loading capacities, and the engine characteristics of the different vessels by using EUROSTAT data, Sea Web Lloyd's database, and international literature. The transport activity module transforms total cargo handled (mainly based on EUROSTAT data and CEMT statistics) into ship-equivalents. These ship-equivalents are further transformed into ship-hours. The emission module calculates energy uses and CO2, NOX, SO2, CO, HC, CH4, NMHC, PM emissions from the resulting maritime activities. We have used technology based emission factors to take into account the technological evolution of vessels. To illustrate this new methodology, we present some results (emissions, fuel consumption and emission factors) for different countries. The overall methodology as well as the results and the country specific energy consumption and emission factors per ship type and size class can be extracted from the EX-TREMIS website (www.ex-tremis.eu). Our results contribute to more accurate estimates of emissions and air quality assessments in coastal cities and ports. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Several general themes emerge from the discussion, including: • No single instrument is clearly superior along all the dimensions relevant to policy choice; even the ranking along a single dimension often depends on the circumstances involved. • Significant trade-offs arise in the choice of instrument. In particular, assuring a reason- able degree of fairness in the distribution of impacts, or ensuring political feasibility, often will require a sacrifice of cost-effectiveness. • It is sometimes desirable to design hybrid instruments that combine features of various instruments in their “pure” form. • For many pollution problems, more than one market failure may be involved, which may justify (on efficiency grounds, at least) employingmore than one instrument. • Potential interactionsamongenvironmentalpolicy instruments are a matter of concern, as arepossible adverse interactionsbetween policies simultaneously pursuedby separate jurisdictions},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have reported associations between fine particles (aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 µm; PM2.5) and mortality. However, concerns have been raised regarding the sensitivity of the results to model specifications, lower exposures, and averaging time. OBJECTIVE: We addressed these issues using 11 additional years of follow-up of the Harvard Six Cities study, incorporating recent lower exposures. METHODS: We replicated the previously applied Cox regression, and examined different time lags, the shape of the concentration-response relationship using penalized splines, and changes in the slope of the relation over time. We then conducted Poisson survival analysis with time-varying effects for smoking, sex, and education. RESULTS: Since 2001, average PM2.5 levels, for all six cities, were < 18 µg/m3. Each increase in PM2.5 (10 µg/m3) was associated with an adjusted increased risk of all-cause mortality (PM2.5 average on previous year) of 14% [95% confidence interval (CI): 7, 22], and with 26% (95% CI: 14, 40) and 37% (95% CI: 7, 75) increases in cardiovascular and lung-cancer mortality (PM2.5 average of three previous years), respectively. The concentration-response relationship was linear down to PM2.5 concentrations of 8 µg/m3. Mortality rate ratios for PM2.5 fluctuated over time, but without clear trends despite a substantial drop in the sulfate fraction. Poisson models produced similar results. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that further public policy efforts that reduce fine particulate matter air pollution are likely to have continuing public health benefits.},

The emissions of SOx, NOx, CO2, CO and PM2.5 were evaluated using the Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM). We have combined the information on individual vessel characteristics and position reports generated by the automatic identification system (AIS). The emission limitations from 2009 to 2011 have had a significant impact on reducing the emissions of both SOx and PM2.5. The predicted emissions of SOx originated from IMO (International Maritime Organization)-registered marine traffic have been reduced by 29%, from 320 kt to 231 kt, in the ECA from 2009 to 2011. The corresponding predicted reduction of PM2.5 emissions was 17%, from 72 kt to 61 kt. The highest CO 2 and PM2.5 emissions in 2011 were located in the vicinity of the coast of the Netherlands, in the English Channel, near the south-eastern UK and along the busiest shipping lines in the Danish Straits and the Baltic Sea. The changes of emissions and the financial costs caused by various regulative actions since 2005 were also evaluated, based on the increased direct fuel costs. We also simulated the effects and direct costs associated with the forthcoming switch to low-sulfur distillate fuels in 2015. According to the projections for the future, there will be a reduction of 87% in SOx emissions and a reduction of 48% in PM2.5 emissions in 2015, compared with the corresponding shipping emissions in 2011 in the ECA. The corresponding relative increase in fuel costs for all IMO-registered shipping varied between 13% and 69%, depending on the development of the prices of fuels and the use of the sulfur scrubber equipment. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {Policy emphasis in ship design must be shifted away from global and idealized towards regional based and realistic vessel operating conditions. The present approach to reducing shipping emissions through technical standards tends to neglect how damages and abatement opportunities vary according to location and operational conditions. Since environmental policy originates in damages relating to ecosystems and jurisdictions, a three-layered approach to vessel emissions is intuitive and practical. Here, we suggest associating damages and policies with ports, coastal areas possibly defined as Emission Control Areas (ECA) as in the North Sea and the Baltic, and open seas globally. This approach offers important practical opportunities: in ports, clean fuels or even electrification is possible; in ECAs, cleaner fuels and penalties for damaging fuels are important, but so is vessel handling, such as speeds and utilization. Globally we argue that it may be desirable to allow burning very dirty fuels at high seas, due to the cost advantages, the climate cooling benefits, and the limited ecosystem impacts. We quantify the benefits and cost savings from reforming current IMO and other approaches towards environmental management with a three-layered approach, and argue it is feasible and worth considering.},

abstract = {Abstract Globalization and transport revolution, logistics integration, and the consequent expansion of port area and hinterland in the maritime industry have redefined the functional role of ports in supply chains and have generated a new pattern of freight distribution. This phenomenon again requires a new approach towards port development and related urban planning. Such changes have inevitably influenced the spatial structure of hub port cities. As existing models on spatial and functional evolution of ports and cities are mainly derived from European and American cases, this paper attempts to introduce evidence from an Asian perspective, focusing on the particular case of global hub port cities such as Hong Kong and Singapore.},

abstract = {Shipping emissions in ports are substantial, accounting for 18 million tonnes of CO2 emissions, 0.4 million tonnes of NOx, 0.2 million of SOx and 0.03 million tonnes of PM10 in 2011. Around 85% of emissions come from containerships and tankers. Containerships have short port stays, but high emissions during these stays. Most of CO2 emissions in ports from shipping are in Asia and Europe (58%), but this share is low compared to their share of port calls (70%). European ports have much less emissions of SOx (5%) and PM (7%) than their share of port calls (22%), which can be explained by the EU regulation to use low sulphur fuels at berth. The ports with the largest absolute emission levels due to shipping are Singapore, Hong Kong (China), Tianjin (China) and Port Klang (Malaysia). The distribution of shipping emissions in ports is skewed: the ten ports with largest emissions represent 19% of total CO2 emissions in ports and 22% of SOx emissions. The port with the lowest relative CO2 emissions (emissions per ship call) is Kitakyushu (Japan); the port of Kyllini (Greece) has the lowest SOx emissions. Other ports with low relative emissions come from Japan, Greece, UK, US and Sweden. Shipping emissions have considerable external costs in ports: almost EUR 12 billion per year in the 50 largest ports in the OECD for NOx, SOx and PM emissions. Approximately 230 million people are directly exposed to the emissions in the top 100 world ports in terms of shipping emissions. Most shipping emissions in ports (CH4, CO, CO2 and NOx) will grow fourfold up to 2050. This would bring CO2-emissions from ships in ports to approximately 70 million tonnes in 2050 and NOx-emissions up to 1.3 million tonnes. Asia and Africa will see the sharpest increases in emissions, due to strong port traffic growth and limited mitigation measures. In order to reduce these projected emissions, strong policy responses will be needed. This could take the form of global regulation such as more stringent rules on sulphur content of ship fuel, or more emission control areas than the four that are currently in place. In addition, shipping could be included in global emissions trading schemes and climate finance schemes. A lot could also be gained by policy initiatives of ports themselves. Various ports have developed infrastructure, regulation and incentives that mitigate shipping emissions in ports. These instruments would need wider application in order for ship emissions in ports to be significantly reduced.},

abstract = {The international marine bunker demand faces many challenges with regard to regulation on fuel quality by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). This paper reviews the most recent challenges and evolutions related to fuel demand and development in international maritime transportation. By developing a simple recursive econometric model, the future demand is forecast under the no-policy change scenario. In the alternative scenario, the impacts of Annex VI of IMO's marine pollution convention on spread price between the high-sulphur and low-sulphur fuel oil are elaborated, and eventually, the impacts on future bunker demand are evaluated. The low price elasticity of bunker demand confirms minimal impacts on demand albeit considerable impacts on running cost of vessels. Bunker demand elasticity with regard to international maritime transportation is estimated at 0.55, showing that inevitable international transportation requirement is the key driver for bunker demand. Implementation of Annex VI would certainly change the mixture of bunker fuel, which mainly depends on the penetration of SO scrubbers on-board of vessels and/or fuel switching. However, due to discrepancy in the level of fuel consumption and uncertain mixture of bunker fuels in the future, the refinery sector and the international maritime transportation sector would face huge uncertainties. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
annote = {Although fuel cost is a major component of the running cost and any price increase will considerably increase the vessel running costs, at the aggregate level, fuel demand is not sensitive to price.That is due to the fact that sea transportation in any cases is relatively the most cost-effective mode of transportation and cargo demand and, in turn, bunker demand for this industry is inevitable.



A 10 per cent increase in real marine diesel oil price will decrease demand by about 0.8 per cent ceteris paribus.

Our conclusion is that we should adopt as our starting point an SPC based on an SCC consistent with range of atmospheric concentrations of carbon identified by the Stern Review as the target for global action. Consideration will also be given to adjusting the SPC in the future in order to bring it progressively in line with the level of marginal abatement costs (MAC) consistent with our abatement goal. It will become possible to do this as our knowledge of UK and global MACs improves over the next couple of years.},

abstract = {Maritime transport plays a central role in the transport sector's sustainability debate. Its contribution to air pollution and greenhouse gases is significant.An effective policy strategy to regulate air emissions requires their robust estimation in terms of quantification and location.This paper provides a critical analysis of the ship emission modelling approaches and data sources available, identifying their limits and constraints. It classifies the main methodologies on the basis of the approach followed (bottom-up or top-down) for the evaluation and geographic characterisation of emissions.The analysis highlights the uncertainty of results from the different methods. This is mainly due to the level of uncertainty connected with the sources of information that are used as inputs to the different studies. This paper describes the sources of the information required for these analyses, paying particular attention to AIS data and to the possible problems associated with their use. One way of reducing the overall uncertainty in the results could be the simultaneous use of different sources of information. This paper presents an alternative methodology based on this approach.As a final remark, it can be expected that new approaches to the problem together with more reliable data sources over the coming years could give more impetus to the debate on the global impact of maritime traffic on the environment that, currently, has only reached agreement via the " consensus" estimates provided by IMO (2009). ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The paper evaluates whether vessel speed reduction can be a potentially cost-effective CO2 mitigation option for ships calling on US ports. By applying a profit-maximizing equation to estimate route-specific, economically-efficient speeds, we explore policy impacts of a fuel tax and a speed reduction mandate on CO2 emissions. The profit-maximizing function incorporates opportunity costs associated with speed reduction that go unobserved in more traditional marginal abatement cost analyses. We find that a fuel tax of about $150/ton fuel will lead to average speed-related CO2 reductions of about 20-30%. Moreover, a speed reduction mandate targeted to achieve 20% CO2 reduction in the container fleet costs between $30 and $200 per ton CO2 abated, depending on how the fleet responds to a speed reduction mandate. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantification of the disease burden caused by different risks informs prevention by providing an account of health loss different to that provided by a disease-by-disease analysis. No complete revision of global disease burden caused by risk factors has been done since a comparative risk assessment in 2000, and no previous analysis has assessed changes in burden attributable to risk factors over time.

METHODS: We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; sum of years lived with disability [YLD] and years of life lost [YLL]) attributable to the independent effects of 67 risk factors and clusters of risk factors for 21 regions in 1990 and 2010. We estimated exposure distributions for each year, region, sex, and age group, and relative risks per unit of exposure by systematically reviewing and synthesising published and unpublished data. We used these estimates, together with estimates of cause-specific deaths and DALYs from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, to calculate the burden attributable to each risk factor exposure compared with the theoretical-minimum-risk exposure. We incorporated uncertainty in disease burden, relative risks, and exposures into our estimates of attributable burden.

FINDINGS: In 2010, the three leading risk factors for global disease burden were high blood pressure (7{\textperiodcentered}0% [95% uncertainty interval 6{\textperiodcentered}2-7{\textperiodcentered}7] of global DALYs), tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6{\textperiodcentered}3% [5{\textperiodcentered}5-7{\textperiodcentered}0]), and alcohol use (5{\textperiodcentered}5% [5{\textperiodcentered}0-5{\textperiodcentered}9]). In 1990, the leading risks were childhood underweight (7{\textperiodcentered}9% [6{\textperiodcentered}8-9{\textperiodcentered}4]), household air pollution from solid fuels (HAP; 7{\textperiodcentered}0% [5{\textperiodcentered}6-8{\textperiodcentered}3]), and tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6{\textperiodcentered}1% [5{\textperiodcentered}4-6{\textperiodcentered}8]). Dietary risk factors and physical inactivity collectively accounted for 10{\textperiodcentered}0% (95% UI 9{\textperiodcentered}2-10{\textperiodcentered}8) of global DALYs in 2010, with the most prominent dietary risks being diets low in fruits and those high in sodium. Several risks that primarily affect childhood communicable diseases, including unimproved water and sanitation and childhood micronutrient deficiencies, fell in rank between 1990 and 2010, with unimproved water and sanitation accounting for 0{\textperiodcentered}9% (0{\textperiodcentered}4-1{\textperiodcentered}6) of global DALYs in 2010. However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa childhood underweight, HAP, and non-exclusive and discontinued breastfeeding were the leading risks in 2010, while HAP was the leading risk in south Asia. The leading risk factor in Eastern Europe, most of Latin America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa in 2010 was alcohol use; in most of Asia, North Africa and Middle East, and central Europe it was high blood pressure. Despite declines, tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke remained the leading risk in high-income north America and western Europe. High body-mass index has increased globally and it is the leading risk in Australasia and southern Latin America, and also ranks high in other high-income regions, North Africa and Middle East, and Oceania.

INTERPRETATION: Worldwide, the contribution of different risk factors to disease burden has changed substantially, with a shift away from risks for communicable diseases in children towards those for non-communicable diseases in adults. These changes are related to the ageing population, decreased mortality among children younger than 5 years, changes in cause-of-death composition, and changes in risk factor exposures. New evidence has led to changes in the magnitude of key risks including unimproved water and sanitation, vitamin A and zinc deficiencies, and ambient particulate matter pollution. The extent to which the epidemiological shift has occurred and what the leading risks currently are varies greatly across regions. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risks are still those associated with poverty and those that affect children.

abstract = {As one of the busiest port in the world, ship emissions have become of great concern in Hong Kong. In this study, a detailed maritime emission inventory for ocean-going vessels (OGVs) in Hong Kong with the base year of 2007 was developed. The high-resolution vessel speed profiles determined using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) during 2009 were adopted for the speed data in the estimation. It was obtained that the total ship emissions from 37,150 voyages of OGVs in 2007 were 17,097, 8190, and 1035tonnes accounting for 17%, 11%, and 16% of the total emissions of NO x, SO 2, and PM 10, respectively. The contribution of ship emissions during transiting was 60-68% for three pollutants while the emissions during hotelling were responsible for the remaining portions. From the emission spatial allocation, the shipping route along the East Lamma Channel and the berthing location of the Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi Container Port comprised the regions with the highest emissions. The OGV emissions in Hong Kong contributed 0.07% NO x, 0.05% SO 2, and 0.06% PM 10 out of the global total shipping emissions in 2007. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Emission generated by the international merchant fleet has been suggested to represent a significant contribution to the global anthropogenic emissions. To analyze the impacts of these emissions, we present detailed model studies of the changes in atmospheric composition of pollutants and greenhouse compounds due to emissions from cargo and passenger ships in international trade. Global emission inventories of NOx, SO2, CO, CO2, and volatile organic compounds (VOC) are developed by a bottom-up approach combining ship-type specific engine emission modeling, oil cargo VOC vapor modeling, alternative global distribution methods, and ship operation data. Calculated bunker fuel consumption is found in agreement with international sales statistics. The Automated Mutual-assistance Vessel Rescue system (AMVER) data set is found to best reflect the distributions of cargo ships in international trade. A method based on the relative reporting frequency weighted by the ship size for each vessel type is recommended. We have exploited this modeled ship emissions inventory to estimate perturbations of the global distribution of ozone, methane, sulfate, and nitrogen compounds using a global 3-D chemical transport model with interactive ozone and sulfate chemistry. Ozone perturbations are highly nonlinear, being most efficient in regions of low background pollution. Different data sets (e.g., AMVER, The Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS)) lead to highly different regional perturbations. A maximum ozone perturbation of approximately 12 ppbv is obtained in the North Atlantic and in the North Pacific during summer months. Global average sulfate loading increases with 2.9%, while the increase is significantly larger over parts of western Europe (up to 8%). In contrast to the AMVER data, the COADS data give particularly large enhancements over the North Atlantic. Ship emissions reduce methane lifetime by approximately 5%. CO2 and O3 give positive radiative forcing (RF), and CH4 and sulfate give negative forcing. The total RF is small (0.01–0.02 W/m2) and connected with large uncertainties. Increase in acidification is 3–10% in certain coastal areas. The approach presented here is clearly useful for characterizing the present impact of ship emission and will be valuable for assessing the potential effect of various emission-control options.},

abstract = {International shipping is a vital channel linking the world economy, particularly from the perspective of international commodity trade. The recently proposed carbon regulation in international shipping will not only affect the competitiveness of shipping lines, but will also have implications for the global economy. This paper adopts an energy–environmental version of the Global Trade Analysis Project referred to as GTAP-E to analyze the quantitative effects of a maritime carbon tax on the global economy by placing a special focus on containerizable commodities given their significant role in international trade. The major advantage of the GTAP-E model is that it can capture the effects of asymmetric changes in freight costs on different routes caused by the maritime carbon tax. Based on our numerical results, imposing a maritime carbon tax on international container shipping will not lead to a significant economic impact unless the tax level is high. China will suffer the greatest real GDP loss among all countries. Under a high level of global maritime carbon tax ($90/tCO2), the real GDP loss to China will be around 0.02%. The negative economic impacts on the European countries will be greater if a maritime carbon tax is imposed only on the European container exporting/importing routes, compared to the situation where a global maritime carbon tax is imposed on container shipping. Finally, the imposition of a maritime carbon tax will discourage distant container trade on the routes (origin–destination) “China–USA”, “Rest of Asia–USA”, and “South America–China”.},
annote = {First, the imposition of a maritime carbon tax on international container shipping will result in significant economic impacts only if the tax level is high. Medium and low carbon tax scenarios show no measurable changes. Therefore, imposing a maritime carbon tax on international container shipping is not expected to have a significantly negative impact on the world economy. 

(see page 8)


If the EU takes a further step to introduce a unilateral regulation on the CO2 emissions of international seaborne transport, the shipping companies serving the EU route will inevitably face a dramatic loss in container volumes, and they should pay special attention to developing competitive shipping strategies in order to avoid potential profit erosion.

Challenging recent claims to the contrary, its findings are that the enactment of extraterritorial legislation by the EU is extremely rare. Nevertheless, the EU makes frequent recourse to a legislative tech- nique that I term territorial extension, in order to gain regulatory traction over activities that take place abroad. This technique not only leads to the EU governing transactions that are not centered upon the territory of the EU, but it also enables the EU to influence the nature and content of third country and international law. Nevertheless, it is inaccurate to say that the EU thereby seeks to export its own norms. EU legislation which engages in territorial extension is generally characterized by an international orientation revealing the EU to be engaged in action-forcing contingent unilateralism rather than the ex- portation of norms. The EU seeks to galvanize third country or global action to tackle transboundary problems and to pursue objectives that have been internationally agreed upon. The importance to the EU of this international orientation is clear from the criticisms that the EU has made of extraterritoriality and territorial extension in United States law.},

abstract = {International aviation and maritime transport account for a significant and growing share of global carbon emissions. Yet they are not only excluded from the Kyoto agreement and all current carbon pricing schemes, but do not even pay fuel excises of the type standard for other transport activities. Moreover, each sector benefits from preferential tax treatment – failure to charge VAT on international aviation, and the application of tonnage tax regimes rather than the normal corporate tax in maritime. This paper considers the design of fuel charges in these sectors to address these distortions, and quantifies their impact on emissions, revenue and welfare – showing, amongst other things, that the gain from offsetting the pre-existing tax distortions may be as significant as those from reducing emissions. It shows, too, how compensation schemes can be designed to protect the poorest countries – a key ingredient in the politics of the issue, given the practical need for wide applicability of such charges. The real challenge is to amass the degree of international cooperation required (especially strong for maritime), failure of which to some degree explains their current under-taxation – and, unsurprisingly, to decide who gets the money. Technically, these charges should, if anything, be rather easy to implement.},

abstract = {After regulating Greenhouse Gas emissions from air transport, the European Union is now contemplating taking action on emissions from the shipping sector. In order to do so, the European Commission carried out a public consultation process between January and April 2012. This article analyses the legal problems that would arise, in the light of Public International Law, should the European Union decide to follow the path of aviation and include shipping under the European Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). To do so, the focus will be placed on six different normative bodies of international law: (1) the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol;(2) the MARPOL Convention; (3) the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea; (4) the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the General Agreement on Trade of Services; (5) the principle of sovereignty over maritime areas; and (6) the bilateral agreements ratified by the EU containing clauses on maritime transport. The structure of each of the six normative bodies will be as follows: international commitments under each international norm, possibility of enforcement before tribunals and analysis of the legality of the EU measure in relation to that norm. 1},

abstract = {In this paper, it is argued that port authorities can actively contribute to better hinterland access. Different types of involvement of the port authority are discussed, as well as reasons for such involvement. The analysis is explorative and aims to provide a basis for further discussion. The analysis applies to landlord port authorities (PAs) with public goals. Landlord port authorities have become more autonomous and take the initiative for expansion and redevelopment of port infrastructure. The activities of PAs can be classified in four broad categories: traffic management, customer management, area management and stakeholder management. PAs traditionally act as landlords but increasingly operate ‘beyond the landlord' model. The main argument for a more active involvement of the PA is the fact that coordination in clusters as well as transport chains does not always emerge spontaneously, for various reasons. More coordination can lead to more efficient supply chains and more competitive ports. Consequently, PAs have incentives to invest to improve coordination in port clusters and supply chains. A more active involvement is especially relevant in hinterland transport, as this is rapidly becoming the main bottleneck in international door-to-door transport chains. PAs may contribute to efficient hinterland access by investing in infrastructure and terminals inside the port area, but perhaps also outside this port area. PAs may also improve hinterland access by setting infrastructure access rules, investing in a port community system, by setting conditions in terminal concessions and finally by ensuring sufficient competition between firms in all parts of the supply chain. These roles of PAs are certainly not relevant in all ports but may provide a challenging perspective for PAs that wish to explore a more active role to improve hinterland access.},

This paper provides the emission measurements of gases, particulate matter (PM), metals, ions, elemental and organic carbon, conducted from the main engine of an ocean going PanaMax class container vessel, at certification cycle and at vessel speed reduction mode, during actual operation at sea. The weighted emission factor (g kW-1 h-1) of PM and NOx were 1.64 and 18.2, respectively, for the main engine operating on a 2.05 wt% sulfur heavy fuel oil (HFO). The NOx emissions at the vessel speed reduction mode (8% of full load) are 30% higher than at 52% engine power, the normal cruise speed. The composition of PM, from main engine is dominated by sulfate and water bound with sulfate (about 80% of total PM) and organic carbon constitutes about 15% of the PM. Sulfur, vanadium and nickel are the significant elements in the exhaust from the engine running on the HFO. At the point of sampling 3.7-5.0% of the fuel sulfur was converted to sulfate. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to randomly generate interbank networks while overcoming shortcomings in the availability of bank-by-bank bilateral exposures. Our model can be used to simulate and assess interbank contagion effects on banking sector soundness and resilience. We find a strongly non-linear pattern across the distribution of simulated networks, whereby only for a small percentage of networks the impact of interbank contagion will substantially reduce average solvency of the system. In the vast majority of the simulated networks the system-wide contagion effects are largely negligible. The approach furthermore enables to form a view about the most systemic banks in the system in terms of the banks whose failure would have the most detrimental contagion effects on the system as a whole. Finally, as the simulation of the network structures is computationally very costly, we also propose a simplified measure - a so-called Systemic Probability Index (SPI) - that also captures the likelihood of contagion from the failure of a given bank to honour its interbank payment obligations but at the same time is less costly to compute. We find that the SPI is broadly consistent with the results from the simulated network structures.},

abstract = {The Big Crunch was the implosion of the global money supply on 15 September 2008, following the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers' bank. It was a nonlinear and sudden catastrophic event for the global economic system, unprecedented in scale in human history. The initial shock alone has been great enough to provoke at least a strong recession in several industrialized economies (e.g. US, UK, Japan, Germany) even with fiscal stimuli to offset reductions in real investment that are already evident in many economies, particularly in housing. If trust is not rapidly restored, the world economy may face a depression more severe than the Great Depression, 1929–1934. This paper starts by explaining the characteristics of money that are essential in understanding the Big Crunch and then outlines the likely sources and consequences of the crisis as based on loss of trust in money and the banking system. The paper concludes by outlining a seven-point plan for resolving the crisis, including a programme of real investment, which will also kick-start the long-term action needed to avoid dangerous climate change. Global GDP is expected to fall by 2.3% in 2009 and again by 2.3% in 2010 on policies announced as of January 2009. The 7-point plan is projected to limit the decline to 2009.},

abstract = {For a number of patients with bipolar disorder, current pharmacotherapy is generally insufficient. Despite adequate treatment, patients continue to have recurrent mood episodes, residual symptoms, functional impairment, psychosocial disability, and significant medical and psychiatric comorbidity. Drug development for bipolar disorder may occur through one of two approaches: the first is by understanding the therapeutically relevant biochemical targets of currently effective medications. Two promising direct targets of lithium and valproate are glycogen synthase kinase-3 and histone deacetylase. The second path results from our understanding that severe mood disorders, although not classical neurodegenerative disorders, are associated with regional impairments of structural plasticity and cellular resilience. This suggests that effective treatments will need to provide both trophic and neurochemical support, which serves to enhance and maintain normal synaptic connectivity, thereby allowing the chemical signal to reinstate the optimal functioning of critical circuits necessary for normal affective functioning. For many refractory patients, drugs mimicking "traditional" strategies, which directly or indirectly alter monoaminergic levels, may be of limited benefit. Newer "plasticity enhancing" strategies that may have utility in the treatment of mood disorders include inhibitors of glutamate release, N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid potentiators, cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and glucocorticoid receptor antagonists},

abstract = {The Basel Accords, while extremely influential, are oftentimes too detailed and technical to be easily accessible to the nontechnical policymaker or interested scholar. This paper looks to fill that gap by
detailing the origin, regulation, implementation, criticism, and results of both Basel I and Basel II.
Findings of not include (1) the limited scope and general language of Basel I gives banks excessive
leeway in their interpretation of its rules, and, in the end, allows financial institutions to take improper
risks and hold unduly low capital reserves; (2) Basel II seeks to extend the breath and precision of
Basel I, bringing in factors such as market and operational risk, market-based discipline and
surveillance, and regulatory mandates, but is oftentimes excessively long and complex; (3) both Basel I
and II effectively ignore the implications of their rules on emerging market banks; and that (4) although
each accord states that its positions are not recommended for application in emerging market
economies, the use of Basel I and II by most private and public organizations as truly international
banking standards predicates the inclusion of emerging markets in each accord.},

abstract = {Financial network models are a useful tool to model interconnectedness and systemic risks in financial systems. They are essentially descriptive, and based on highly correlated networks. In this paper we embed them in a stochastic frame- work, aimed at a more parsimonious and more realistic representation. First we introduce Gaussian graphical models in the field of systemic risk modelling, thus estimating the adjacency matrix of a network in a robust and coherent way. Second, we propose a conditional graphical model that can usefully decompose correlations between financial institutions into correlations between countries and correlations between institutions, within countries. While the former may be further explained by macroeconomic variables, the latter may be further ex- plained by idiosyncratic balance sheet indicators. We have applied our proposed methods to the largest European banks, with the aim of identifying central in- stitutions, more subject to contagion or, conversely, whose failure could result in further distress or breakdowns in the whole system. Our results show that, in the transmission of the perceived default risk, there is a strong country effect, that reflects the weakness and the strength of the underlying economies. In addition, each country reveals specific idiosyncratic factors, with communalities among similar countries.},

Money creation in practice differs from some popular misconceptions--banks do not act simply as intermediaries, lending out deposits that savers place with them, and nor do they "multiply up" central bank money to create new loans and deposits. The amount of money created in the economy ultimately depends on the monetary policy of the central bank. In normal times, this is carried out by setting interest rates. The central bank can also affect the amount of money directly through purchasing assets or "quantitative easing."},

abstract = {We use financial accounts data at sector level to construct financial networks for individual euro area countries. We then connect the country-level networks to one large “Macro Network”, using information on cross-border linkages between the national banking sectors. We then evaluate the features of the resulting framework using various network statistics. Shock simulations reveal that the structural features of the bilateral linkages are a key determinant of the losses that may be generated when the shocks propagate in the system. The network structures evolve over time, showing increasing interconnectedness in different instrument categories before the financial crisis hit in 2007, and a sharp retrenchment from bilateral exposures after the crisis started. This reflects the surge in counterparty risk and the de-leveraging processes which were triggered by the initial asset price losses and were further amplified by the economic downturn. As a consequence, there was a marked deterioration in financial integration both within economies and across countries in the euro area. Nonetheless, our analysis suggests that the risk of contagion is not reduced, while a more diversified portfolio of cross-border exposures might mitigate shocks effects.},

Post-Keynesian economics is founded on realistic assumptions and stylized facts, such as interest targeting by central banks or constant average variable costs in manufacturing and services. The author shows how these more realistic foundations give rise to macroeconomic implications that are entirely different from those of received wisdom with regards to employment, output growth, inflation and monetary theory. For instance, the author demonstrates that higher minimum wages or real wages can increase both labour employment and the corporate profit rates, and that faster output growth need not lead to higher inflation.},

abstract = {This paper presents an accounting framework for measuring the sources and uses of short-term\nfunding in the global financial ecosystem. We introduce a dynamic map of global funding flows to\nshow how dealer banks emerged as intermediaries between two types of asset managers: cash pools\nsearching for safety via collateralized cash investments and levered portfolio managers searching for\nyield via funded securities portfolios and derivatives. We argue that the monetary aggregates (M0, M1,\nM2, etc.) and the Financial Accounts of the United States (formerly the Flow of Funds) do not\nadequately reflect the institutional realities of the modern financial ecosystem, and should be updated to\nallow policymakers to better analyze and monitor the shadow banking system and its potential\ncontributions to financial instability. The monetary aggregates, used mainly to inform the aggregate\ndemand management aspects of monetary policy, do not include the instruments that asset managers\nuse as money, particularly repos. Asset managers' money demand is not driven by transaction needs in\nthe real economy but in the financial economy: in this sense, repo-based money dealing activities in the\nshadow banking system are about the provision of working capital for asset managers, much like real\nbills provided working capital for merchants and manufacturers in Bagehot's world over 150 years ago.\nThese developments should be systematically captured in a new set of Flow of Collateral, Flow of Risk\nand Flow of Eurodollar satellite accounts to supplement the Financial Accounts. The accounting\nframework presented with this paper also explains how the Federal Reserve's reverse repo facility helps\nreduce interconnections within the financial system and how they could evolve into minimum liquidity\nrequirements for shadow banks and a tool to control market-based credit cycles. The global macro\ndrivers behind the secular rise of cash pools and leveraged portfolio managers in the asset management\ncomplex are identical with the real economy drivers behind the idea of secular stagnation. As such, one\nway to interpret shadow banking is as the financial economy reflection of real economy imbalances\ncaused by excess global savings, slowing potential growth, and the rising share of corporate profits\nrelative to wages in national income.},

abstract = {An increase in the wage share has contradictory effects on the subaggregates of aggregate demand. Private consumption expenditures ought to increase because wage incomes typically are associated with higher consumption propensities than capital incomes. Investment expenditures ought to be negatively affected because investment will positively depend on profits. Net exports will be negatively affected because an increase in the wage share corresponds to an increase in unit labour costs and thus a loss in competitiveness. Therefore, theoretically, aggregate demand can be either wage-led or profit-led depending on how these effects add up. The results will crucially depend on how open the economy is internationally. The paper estimates a post-Kaleckian macro model incorporating these effects for the Euro area and finds that the Euro area is presently in a wage-led demand regime. Implications for wage policies are discussed.},

They emphasise that our ability to explain phenomena like the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) will be limited while ever we are still unable to explain this fundamental aspect of capitalism. \nIn fact this paradox can be solved very simply, using insights from what is known as ``Circuit Theory''. In this paper the author shows how monetary profits are generated, and uses a monetary circuit of production model to derive policy conclusions about how to overcome a ``credit crunch'' that reverse the guidance given by the standard but empirically falsified ``money multiplier'' model of credit money creation.},

abstract = {The Big Crunch was the implosion of the global money supply on 15 September 2008, following the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers' bank. It was a nonlinear and sudden catastrophic event for the global economic system, unprecedented in scale in human history. The initial shock alone has been great enough to provoke at least a strong recession in several industrialized economies (e.g. US, UK, Japan, Germany) even with fiscal stimuli to offset reductions in real investment that are already evident in many economies, particularly in housing. If trust is not rapidly restored, the world economy may face a depression more severe than the Great Depression, 1929–1934. This paper starts by explaining the characteristics of money that are essential in understanding the Big Crunch and then outlines the likely sources and consequences of the crisis as based on loss of trust in money and the banking system. The paper concludes by outlining a seven-point plan for resolving the crisis, including a programme of real investment, which will also kick-start the long-term action needed to avoid dangerous climate change. Global GDP is expected to fall by 2.3% in 2009 and again by 2.3% in 2010 on policies announced as of January 2009. The 7-point plan is projected to limit the decline to 2009.},

This paper outlines the results from a herding task designed to extend these analyses using evidence from a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Empirically, we estimate logistic functions using panel estimation techniques to quantify the impact of herd decisions on individuals' financial decisions. We confirm that there are statistically significant propensities to herd and that social information about others' decisions has an impact on individuals' decisions. We extend these findings by identifying associations between herding propensities and individual characteristics including gender, age and various personality traits. In addition fMRI evidence shows that individual differences correlate strongly with activations in the amygdala – an area of the brain commonly associated with social decision-making. Individual differences also correlate strongly with amygdala activations during herding decisions. These findings are used to construct a two stage least squares model of financial herding which confirms that individual differences and neural responses play a role in modulating the propensity to herd.},

abstract = {We study the relationship between the risk preferences of individuals and the risk preferences of the aggregate economy. To emphasize the vast differences that can occur between individual and market preferences brought about through aggregation, we assume an economy consisting entirely of risk seekers. We show that such individuals can lead to an aggregate economy that is risk averse. The converse is also true. An aggregate economy that exhibits risk aversion does not imply an economy of individual risk averters. An economy demanding a risk premium can be formed from individuals who do not demand such compensation. Understanding the relationship between the preferences of individuals and the preferences of the aggregate economy is crucial for understanding the connection between the behavioral finance literature, which focuses on individual preferences, and the asset-pricing literature, which focuses on aggregate prices. We discuss empirical implications of these results. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {In an era filled with fears of bioterrorism, Congress approved the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREPA) to encourage development of vaccines and other countermeasures. By providing pharmaceutical manufacturers with protection from liability for potential side effects, Congress has attempted to motivate manufacturers to produce a national stockpile of countermeasures. As part of PREPA, the government established a compensatory system intended to provide compensation to persons injured by countermeasures used during a public health emergency. Although the Act provides for a compensation fund, it fails to allocate monies for that fund. Thus, in the absence of further congressional action, PREPA will not provide compensation to those injured by countermeasures. Failing to assure the American public of a compensation program constitutes bad public policy and risks inspiring potential vaccinees to refuse necessary drugs. Additionally, arguments as to the constitutionality of the Act exist should Congress fail to adequately fund the program, and the existence of those arguments undermines the purpose of the Act--namely to assure pharmaceutical manufacturers that they will not be sued into oblivion should they attempt to aid national pandemic protection. In addition to detailing both the Act and the statutory precedent for congressional attempts to spur biodefense, this Article addresses important issues of healthcare, tort, and constitutional law that will continue to manifest themselves in this new era of bioterrorism.},

abstract = {Decision making under risk is central to human behavior. Economic decision theory suggests that value, risk, and risk aversion influence choice behavior. Although previous studies identified neural correlates of decision parameters, the contribution of these correlates to actual choices is unknown. In two different experiments, participants chose between risky and safe options. We identified discrete blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) correlates of value and risk in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate, respectively. Notably, increasing inferior frontal gyrus activity to low risk and safe options correlated with higher risk aversion. Importantly, the combination of these BOLD responses effectively decoded the behavioral choice. Striatal value and cingulate risk responses increased the probability of a risky choice, whereas inferior frontal gyrus responses showed the inverse relationship. These findings suggest that the BOLD correlates of decision factors are appropriate for an ideal observer to detect behavioral choices. More generally, these biological data contribute to the validity of the theoretical decision parameters for actual decisions under risk.},

abstract = {This study reviews different approaches to the political and economic control of global public goods such as global warming. It compares quantity-oriented control mechanisms like the Kyoto Protocol with price-type control mechanisms such as internationally harmonized carbon taxes. The analysis focuses on such issues as the relationship to ultimate targets, performance under conditions of uncertainty, volatility of induced carbon prices, the inefficiencies of taxation and regulation, potential for corruption and accounting finagling, and ease of implementation. It concludes that price-type approaches such as carbon taxes have major advantages for slowing global warming.},

@article{Barker1993,
abstract = {A carbon/energy tax has been proposed by the European Commission to start as US$3 per barrel oil equivalent in 1993, rising to US$10 in 2000. The effects of this tax on the UK economy can be assessed by using a large-scale energy-environment-economy model in which energy demand is treated by means of aggregate equations for energy users and fuel share equations for electricity and each of the main fossil fuels. The electricity supply industry is represented in the model by simulating the characteristics of each existing generating station and of a range of new station types, and by allowing the model to choose the fuels used from relative fuel prices and prices of capital inputs. This approach contrasts with the multimodel approach used in most studies of the effects of the tax. The tax is introduced as a tax on imports and domestic output of fossil fuels in proportion to their carbon and energy content, with the tax being passed on through the economic system depending on the use of the fuels. Thus the electricity industry is faced with higher prices for coal, gas and fuel oil and chooses to burn the different fuels according to their relative prices. Four scenarios are developed, which vary according to the way the tax revenues are recycled through reductions in VAT or in income tax rates and whether the tax is introduced throughout the European Community or throughout the OECD. If the tax is European, it is assumed that the energy intensive industries will be exempt. The outcome is that the tax is sufficient to stabilize CO2 emissions over the period 1990-2005, at 12% below base levels by the end of the period. There is an overall saving of energy compared to base and a further switch to gas in electricity generation. The effects on the macroeconomy are rather small, and as the revenues are recycled, rather than saved by the government, GDP growth is likely to increase under the tax by some 0.2% above base. This confirms other studies in which revenues are recycled, but contradicts many results from studies in which revenue recycling is ignored or incomplete. The effects on the energy intensive industries are expected to be small in all the scenarios, but 14% of tax revenues are lost if the industries are exempt.},

Different approaches were used for commercial and residential land. Data deficiencies were a major problem and it was not possible to combine the results. Commercial land value uplift could not be quantified. For residential land the total figure ({\pounds}9 billion) for the Jubilee Line Extension (JLE) was based on calculations for five stations. This could be several billion pounds higher or lower. The JLE actually cost {\pounds}3.5 billion. Although a method of spatially analyzing commercial ratable values was developed, data deficiencies prevented modeling a true 'landvaluescape'. It was concluded that this did not significantly affect the accuracy of results.},

@article{EqualityTrust2014,
abstract = {Previous studies addressing the association between income inequality and participation suggest that in societies in which there is high income inequality, participation is low. This has been attributed to two different theories. The 'sociological' theory proposes that in more unequal societies the poor abstain from participation, show lower levels of generalised trust and develop bad health because they are more distressed by their disadvantaged position than they would have been if society had been more egalitarian. The 'neoliberal' theory, by contrast, attributes the lower levels of participation in more unequal societies to the resources people have available to them at both the individual and the collective level. At the individual level this manifests as income and education, while at the collective level this includes GDP and the extent to which the state provides welfare to its citizens. New income inequality research from the University of Amsterdam empirically disentangles the two theoretical explanations, examining how inequality in various parts of the income distribution is related to civic, cultural and social participation. A substantial part of the impact of inequality is found to manifest itself through resources at the individual and collective level. However, the researchers also found that, independent of resources, higher inequality magnifies the relationship between income and participation. This supports research which cites inter-individual processes as the principle explanation of the association between high inequality and low participation.},

The impact of the credit crunch and recession on the housing market is being felt across the country. Behind these headlines are the individual stories of people being repossessed, suffering from overcrowding and struggling to find a decent, affordable home. Even before the recession, the lack of affordable housing in Britain was starting to dictate how people lived their everyday lives. The recession has made this worse and with house building at its lowest level since 1946, we are now at crisis point. In this report, we examine the far reaching consequences of our housing crisis – the way unaffordable housing affects relationships, job prospects, mental health and even the family nucleus. We look at the emotional cost as well as the financial, recognising a home is not just a financial asset, but the bedrock of security and stability. Housing is no longer simply a concern for low-income households, but an issue for everyone. If nothing is done, it could mean we sleepwalk into an even bigger housing crisis affecting generations to come. We believe all political parties must recognise solving our housing crisis is as fundamental as health and education. The situation is unacceptable and we need to act now.},

In this wide-ranging and provocative book, Kenneth Scheve and David Stasavage ask when and why countries tax their wealthiest citizens—and their answers may surprise you. Taxing the Rich draws on unparalleled evidence from twenty countries over the last two centuries to provide the broadest and most in-depth history of progressive taxation available. Scheve and Stasavage explore the intellectual and political debates surrounding the taxation of the wealthy while also providing the most detailed examination to date of when taxes have been levied against the rich and when they haven't. Fairness in debates about taxing the rich has depended on different views of what it means to treat people as equals and whether taxing the rich advances or undermines this norm. Scheve and Stasavage argue that governments don't tax the rich just because inequality is high or rising—they do it when people believe that such taxes compensate for the state unfairly privileging the wealthy. Progressive taxation saw its heyday in the twentieth century, when compensatory arguments for taxing the rich focused on unequal sacrifice in mass warfare. Today, as technology gives rise to wars of more limited mobilization, such arguments are no longer persuasive. Taxing the Rich shows how the future of tax reform will depend on whether political and economic conditions allow for new compensatory arguments to be made.},

abstract = {In this paper, which forms a chapter in the forthcoming Book “Delivering a Low Carbon Electricity System: Technologies, Economics and Policy”, Grubb and Newbery examine how carbon for electricity generation should be priced. They begin by suggesting that it is not clear what the correct price of carbon is, but that it spans the whole range of economically plausible prices. They then go on to discuss the theoretical merits of taxes versus quotas, concluding that theoretically a stable tax would best reflect the true social cost of emissions, which should not change with market conditions. They then go to evaluate the EU Emissions Trading Scheme where allowances for the emission of CO2 are traded (EUAs). The price signals offered by the scheme in its first trading period have been very unsatisfactory with high variability and the price trending down towards very low levels as it has become clear that governments were much too generous in their initial allocation of quotas. What is needed is a stable investment environment for low carbon generation investments. They discuss a number of policy options to achieve this: long period commitments on quotas; allowing unconstrained banking and borrowing of EUAs over multiple periods; long term price declarations to be used in allocation auctions; government issued contracts for differences on the future carbon price; or simply to issue low-carbon electricity contracts. The authors conclude with a discussion of the scope for international agreements on carbon emissions reduction. They conclude that imperfect though it is the EU ETS is a good place to start to link up emerging trading regimes, and that quota systems have more of a chance of commanding international agreement at least initially. However any international climate change agreement will be difficult to establish.},

abstract = {This paper presents summary statistics on the occupations of taxpayers in the top percentile of the national income distribution and fractiles thereof, as well as the patterns of real income growth between 1979 and 2005 for top earners in each occupation, based on information reported on U.S. individual income tax returns. The data demonstrate that executives, managers, supervisors, and financial professionals account for about 60 percent of the top 0.1 percent of income earners in recent years, and can account for 70 percent of the increase in the share of national income going to the top 0.1 percent of the income distribution between 1979 and 2005. During 1979-2005 there was substantial heterogeneity in growth rates of income for top earners across occupations, and significant divergence in incomes within occupations among people in the top 1 percent. We consider the implications for various competing explanations for the substantial changes in income inequality that have occurred in the U.S. in recent times. It is well known that the share of the nation's income going to the top percentiles of the income distribution in the United States has increased dramatically over the past three decades. Data from individual income tax returns tabulated by Piketty and Saez (2003, updated 2008) and shown in Figure 1 demonstrates that the percentage of all pre-tax income (excluding capital gains) in the United States that was received by the top 0.1 percent of income earners rose strikingly from 2.2 percent to 8.0 percent between 1981 and 2006. But until now, there has been little hard data available to the public on what these people typically do for a living, which is an economically important question. Kaplan and Rauh (2010) estimate what share of tax returns at the top of the income distribution can be accounted for through publicly-available information on top executives of publicly-traded firms, financial professionals, law partners, and professional athletes and celebrities. Despite making various extrapolations beyond what is directly available in publicly-available data sources, for the year 2004 they are only able to identify the occupations of 17.4 percent of the top 0.1 percent of income earners. As Kaplan and Rauh, among others (e.g., Gordon and Dew-Becker, 2008) have emphasized, the questions of what proportion of people in the top income percentiles are in different occupations, and how these proportions have been changing over time, have important implications for evaluating competing explanations for the rapid rise in incomes at the top. Yet until now we have had very incomplete information on these questions. The main contribution of our paper is to present summary statistics tabulated from cross-sectional individual income tax return data at the U.S. Treasury Department on what share of top income earners work in each type of occupation, the},

Since such tax competition may have detrimental effects for all countries, European policy makers have debated the introduction of a minimum capital income tax rate within the EU. This paper develops an applied general equilibrium model to estimate the effects of such tax co-ordination on resource allocation, income distribution and social welfare. The model allows for the concern of policy makers that a rise in capital taxes within the EU may cause a capital flight out of Europe. Capital flight will indeed reduce the welfare gain from tax co-ordination within Western Europe, but a positive net gain will remain, although it is likely to be well below 1% of GDP. The gain from co-ordination will be unevenly distributed across European countries, due to differences in economic structures and in the social preference for redistribution. Moreover, even if the median voter's gain from tax co-ordination may be small, the gains for the poorer sections of society may be quite large.},

Cost–benefit analysis would set the optimal amount of greenhouse-gas-emission reduction at the point where this social cost just equals the incremental cost of controlling emissions. The higher the value for the social cost of carbon, the more control is warranted. This comparison assumes that cost–benefit analysis is the correct way of determining climate-change policy, and many believe this is not the case because of the very long-term, irreversible, and potentially catastrophic nature of global warming. But, in the short run at least, a comparison of cost and benefits is required, and, in any event, all decisions imply costs and benefits. But what is the ‘right' figure for the social cost of carbon? This paper reviews the UK government's assessment of the cost and concludes that it has been set far too high because of a misreading of the integrated assessment models used to balance costs and benefits. Moreover, adoption of the UK government's shadow price would have formidable implications for energy policy in the UK, and for policies on afforestation.},

Standard sources of data omit much of the potential tax base, and undervalue what they do measure. The purpose of this paper is to present more comprehensive and accurate measures of land rents and values, and several modes of raising revenues from them besides the conventional property tax.Design/methodology/approach – The paper identifies 16 elements of land's taxable capacity that received authorities either trivialize or omit. These 16 elements come in four groups.Findings – In Group A, Elements 1‐4 correct for the downward bias in standard sources. In Group B, Elements 5‐10 broaden the concepts of land and rent beyond the conventional narrow perception, while Elements 11‐12 estimate rents to be gained by abating other kinds of taxes.

Some contributing factors considered are: the focus on carbon production rather than consumption in the architecture of Kyoto; the flaws in the analysis presented in the Stern Report (notably on the impacts of climate change on economic growth, on the costs of mitigation, and on discounting); and the political economy of the choice of policy instruments, the politics of the rents that arise, and the technology bias. The challenges facing the Copenhagen conference are noted, and it is concluded that, with a recasting of the economics of climate change, the prospects for closing the gap between the science and policy are grim.},

abstract = {This paper describes results from a model of decision-making under uncertainty using a real options methodology, developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The model represents investment decisions in power generation from the perspective of a private company. The investments are subject to uncertain future climate policy, which is treated as an external risk factor over which the company has no control. The aims of this paper are to (i) quantify these regulatory risks in order to improve understanding of how policy uncertainty may affect investment behaviour by private companies and (ii) illustrate the effectiveness of the real options approach as a policy analysis tool. The study analysed firms' investment options of coal- and gas-fired power plants and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Policy uncertainty is represented as an exogenous event that creates uncertainty in the carbon price. Our findings indicate that climate policy uncertainty creates a risk premium for power generation investments. In the case of gas- and coal-fired power generation, the risk premium would lead to an increase in electricity prices of 5-10% in order to stimulate investment. In the case of CCS, the risk premium would increase the carbon price required to stimulate investment by 16-37% compared to a situation of perfect certainty. The option to retrofit CCS acts as a hedge against high future carbon prices, and could accelerate investment in coal plant. This paper concludes that to minimise investment risks in low carbon technologies, policy-makers should aim to provide some long-term regulatory certainty.},

They also accrue to income-earners due to windfall changes in wage rates and rent-seeking opportunities. High-income persons obtain a disproportionate share of rents, and we investigate the consequences of that for Canadian tax policy. Some tax reforms suggested include adopting an allowance for corporate equity business tax system, abolishing the dividend tax credit and preferential treatment of capital gains, limiting the use of tax-free savings accounts, increasing the progressivity of income taxation, and adopting a guaranteed basic income.},

abstract = {Regulatory instruments for greenhouse gas control present a policy dilemma: Market-based instruments such as cap and trade function to reduce regulatory costs; but because they provide no guarantee that costs will be reduced to acceptable levels it is infeasible to set caps at sustainable levels. Emission taxes provide cost certainty, but their comparatively high cost makes it infeasible to set tax rates at levels commensurate with sustainability goals. However, there is a straightforward solution to this dilemma: Just as cap and trade uses free allowance allocation to minimize regulatory costs, an emission tax's cost can be mitigated by refunding tax revenue in such a way that emission reduction becomes profitable. A refunded tax, like cap and trade with free allocation, would be revenue-neutral within the regulated industry. Marginal competitive incentives for commercializing emission-reducing technologies would not be diminished by the refund, and the refund could actually make it politically and economically feasible to increase the incentives by an order of magnitude. Whereas cap and trade merely caps emissions at an unsustainable level while subjecting the economy to extreme price volatility, refunded emission taxes could create a stable investment environment with sustained incentives for emission reduction over a long-term investment horizon.},

This paper begins doing so from the perspective of the developing countries. The principal argument is that we need to return to the basic principles outlined in the Framework Convention on Climate Change in searching for a north–south bargain on climate change. Such a bargain may be achievable if we can realign the policy architecture of the climate regime to its original stated goals of sustainable development.},

@book{PaineAgrarianJustice,
abstract = {To preserve the benefits of what is called civilized life, and to remedyat the same time the evil which it has produced, ought to considered asone of the first objects of reformed legislation. Whether that state that is proudly, perhaps erroneously, called civilization,has most promoted or most injured the general happiness of man is a questionthat may be strongly contested. On one side, the spectator is dazzled bysplendid appearances; on the other, he is shocked by extremes of wretchedness;both of which it has erected. The most affluent and the most miserable ofthe human race are to be found in the countries that are called civilized. To understand what the state of society ought to be, it is necessary to have some idea of the natural and primitive state of man; such as it is at this day among the Indians of North America. There is not, inthat state, any of those spectacles of human misery which poverty and wantpresent to our eyes in all the towns and streets in Europe. Poverty, therefore, is a thing created by that which is called civilizedlife. It exists not in the natural state. On the other hand, the naturalstate is without those advantages which flow from agriculture, arts, scienceand manufactures. The life of an Indian is a continual holiday, compared with the poor ofEurope; and, on the other hand it appears to be abject when compared tothe rich. Civilization, therefore, or that which is so-called, has operated two ways:to make one part of society more affluent, and the other more wretched,than would have been the lot of either in a natural state. It is always possible to go from the natural to the civilized state, butit is never possible to go from the civilized to the natural state. Thereason is that man in a natural state, subsisting by hunting, requires tentimes the quantity of land to range over to procure himself sustenance,than would support him in a civilized state, where the earth is cultivated. When, therefore, a country becomes populous by the additional aids of cultivation,art and science, there is a necessity of preserving things in that state;because without it there cannot be sustenance for more, perhaps, than atenth part of its inhabitants. The thing, therefore, now to be done is toremedy the evils and preserve the benefits that have arisen to society bypassing from the natural to that which is called the civilized state. In taking the matter upon this ground, the first principle of civilizationought to have been, and ought still to be, that the condition of every personborn into the world, after a state of civilization commences, ought notto be worse than if he had been born before that period. But the fact is that the condition of millions, in every country in Europe,is far worse than if they had been born before civilization begin, had beenborn among the Indians of North America at the present. I will show howthis fact has happened. It is a position not to be controverted that the earth, in its natural,cultivated state was, and ever would have continued to be, the commonproperty of the human race. In that state every manwould have been born to property. He would have been a joint life proprietorwith rest in the property of the soil, and in all its natural productions,vegetable and animal. But the earth in its natural state, as before said, is capable of supportingbut a small number of inhabitants compared with what it is capable of doingin a cultivated state. And as it is impossible to separatethe improvement made by cultivation from the earth itself, upon which thatimprovement is made, the idea of landed property arosefrom that parable connection; but it is nevertheless true, that it is thevalue of the improvement, only, and not the earth itself, that is individualproperty. Every proprietor, therefore, of cultivated lands, owes to the community ground-rent (for I know of no better term to express theidea) for the land which he holds; and it is from this ground-rent thatthe fund prod in this plan is to issue. It is deducible, as well from the nature of the thing as from all the storiestransmitted to us, that the idea of landed property commenced with cultivation,and that there was no such thing, as landed property before that time. Itcould not exist in the first state of man, that of hunters. It did not existin the second state, that of shepherds: neither Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, nor Job, so far as the history of the Bible may credited in probablethings, were owners of land. Their property consisted, as is always enumerated in flocksand herds, they traveled with them from place to place. The frequentcontentions at that time about the use of a well in the dry country of Arabia,where those people lived, also show that there was no landed property. Itwas not admitted that land could be claimed as property. There could be no such thing as landed property originally. Man did notmake the earth, and, though he had a natural right to occupy it,he had no right to locate as his property in perpetuityany part of it; neither did the Creator of the earth open a land-office,from whence the first title-deeds should issue. Whence then, arose the ideaof landed property? I answer as before, that when cultivation began theidea of landed property began with it, from the impossibility of separatingthe improvement made by cultivation from the earth itself, upon which thatimprovement was made. The value of the improvement so far exceeded the value of the natural earth,at that time, as to absorb it; till, in the end, the common right of allbecame confounded into the cultivated right of the individual. But thereare, nevertheless, distinct species of rights, and will continue to be,so long as the earth endures. It is only by tracing things to their origin that we can gain rightful ideasof them, and it is by gaining such ideas that we, discover the boundarythat divides right from wrong, and teaches every man to know his own. Ihave entitled this tract "Agrarian Justice" to distinguish itfrom "Agrarian Law." Nothing could be more unjust than agrarian law in a country improved bycultivation; for though every man, as an inhabitant of the earth, is a jointproprietor of it in its natural state, it does not follow that he is a jointproprietor of cultivated earth. The additional value made by cultivation,after the system was admitted, became the property of those who did it,or who inherited it from them, or who purchased it. It had originally noowner. While, therefore, I advocate the right, and interest myself in thehard case of all those who have been thrown out of their natural inheritanceby the introduction of the system of landed property, I equally defend theright of the possessor to the part which is his. Cultivation is at least one of the greatest natural improvements ever madeby human invention. It has given to created earth a tenfold value. But thelanded monopoly that began with it has produced the greatest evil. It hasdispossessed more than half the inhabitants of every nation of their naturalinheritance, without providing for them, as ought to have been done, anindemnification for that loss, and has thereby created a species of povertyand wretchedness that did not exist before. In advocating the case of the persons thus dispossessed, it is a right,and not a charity, that I am pleading for. But it is that kind of rightwhich, being neglected at first, could not be brought forward afterwardstill heaven had opened the way by a revolution in the system of government.Let us then do honor to revolutions by justice, and give currency to theirprinciples by blessings. Having thus in a few words, opened the merits of the case, I shall now proceed to the plan I have to propose, which is, To create a national fund, out of which there shall be paid to every person,when arrived at the age of twenty-one years, the sum of fifteen pounds sterling, as a compensation in part, for the loss of his or her natural inheritance,by the introduction of the system of landed property: And also, the sum of ten pounds per annum, during life, to every person now living, of the age of fifty years, and to all others as they shall arrive at that age.},

abstract = {1 . Main points Median household disposable income in the UK was estimated as {\pounds}25,700 in the financial year ending 2015 (2014/15). This is {\pounds}1,500 higher than its recent low in 2012/13, after accounting for inflation and household composition, and is at a similar level to its pre-downturn value ({\pounds}25,400). The recent increase in disposable incomes has been driven largely by increased household income from employment, due to both average earnings growing in real terms in 2014/15 and continued growth in employment rates. The median disposable income of the richest fifth of households fell the most following the economic downturn (7.9% between 2007/08 and 2012/13). Since then it has increased, but in 2014/15 remained {\pounds}2,000 (3.2%) below its previous peak after accounting for inflation and household composition. The poorest fifth of households were the only group whose average income did not fall between 2007/08 and 2012/13 and in 2014/15 the average income of this group was {\pounds}700 (5.8%) above its 2007/08 value. Estimates of income inequality for 2014/15 are broadly unchanged from those for the previous financial year (any differences are not statistically significant). Since 2007/08, there has been a slight decrease in overall income inequality on a range of measures, although from a longer-term perspective, income inequality remains above levels seen in the early 1980s.},

As the agent moves up his concave utility function, he becomes less risk-averse, in the limit, he moves into a section of his utility function where that one is linear, so he is risk-neutral. Where in this spectrum an agent operates affects to what extend his decisions in life are affected by the variance or the expected returns of any project. Consider what impact this income-dependency of risk preferences has on invest-ments in an economy that grows unequal. In the period between the Great Depression and the income tax reforms of Reagan/Thatcher/Deng/Kohl in the mid-1980s inequal-ity was constantly decreasing 1 , such that the average investor was becoming poorer. If the average investor is relatively poor, it is the variance and not the expected returns that will drive his investment decisions. Accordingly, we would expect a period of very conservative investments. Industry offers mostly conservative investments with normally low but secure re-turns. Also investments in developed countries are generally conservative, as in those countries industrial structures and demand patterns do not change much. These coun-tries are resilient enough to offer security but one cannot expect a big catch-up rush. In the period before the mid-1980s there is therefore a coincidence between the risk pref-erences of the average investor and the risk characteristics of Western industry. Palma (2009) accordingly documents a range of fitting macro-trends, for example a fall of To-bin's Q (an inverse measure of the quantity of unmet needs for investments) throughout this whole period. The tax reforms in the mid-1980s accelerated inequality, not so much for the mass of society (inequality in the middle of the income spectrum actually decreased) but between the very top and the bottom. The average investor became richer again. Com-1 World Top Income Database and Luxembourg Income Study 1 pared to his investment decisions in the past, he now based his decisions more on expected returns now played a larger role relative to variances. As a result, normal industry and generally the entrenchedly-secure but slow-evolving demand patterns of Western markets became less interesting than financial games and risky-but-dynamic periphery markets. Furthermore, as the growing inequality also reduced internal de-mand in Western countries, the already expected returns to investments in the West decreased, providing a second reason for a ship in investment out of industry and into periphery countries. Another effect of the change in inequality has been the expan-sion of available loans, enabling a structural break in the previously-stable relation of private debt to real output. Related to the above problems is personal income tax competition. Historically, most tax havens were created in the same period of the income tax reforms (see Palan). Which event drove which is unclear. Defendants of Reagan/Thatcher/Deng/Kohl argue that Western states had to lower top marginal income taxes in order to prevent the off-flow of high incomes. But if that was the intention, it failed, because the income tax reforms were followed by big out-flows. According to the alternative explanation, the income tax reforms raised inequality, which put a larger number of top incomes beyond a certain threshold required for income shifting to be lucrative. In any case, the tax reforms lowered public revenues twice: through the reduced income tax rates themselves and through the subsequent era of " tax base erosion " were high incomes were shifted from large countries into micro-states. Both effects were the opposite of Rumsfeld's " Laffer Curve " at the initiation of the 1980s reforms.},

@article{Reinhart2013,
abstract = {Even after one of the most severe multi-year crises on record in the advanced economies, the received wisdom in policy circles clings to the notion that high-income countries are completely different from their emerging market counterparts. The current phase of the official policy approach is predicated on the assumption that debt sustainability can be achieved through a mix of austerity, forbearance and growth. The claim is that advanced countries do not need to resort to the standard toolkit of emerging markets, including debt restructurings and conversions, higher inflation, capital controls and other forms of financial repression. As we document, this claim is at odds with the historical track record of most advanced economies, where debt restructuring or conversions, financial repression, and a tolerance for higher inflation, or a combination of these were an integral part of the resolution of significant past debt overhangs.},

We go beyond how much different professions are paid to look at what they contribute to society. We use some of the principles and valuation techniques of Social Return on Investment analysis1 to quantify the social, environmental and economic value that these roles produce – or in some cases undermine. Our report tells the story of six different jobs. We have chosen jobs from across the private and public sectors and deliberately chosen ones that illustrate the problem. Three are low paid – a hospital cleaner, a recycling plant worker and a childcare worker. The others are highly paid – a City banker, an advertising executive and a tax accountant. We recognise that our incentives are created by the institutions and systems around us. It is not our intention therefore, to target the individuals that do these jobs but rather to examine the professions themselves.},

abstract = {HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) lack of transparency has eroded public trust in a fair tax system and makes it more difficult for the department to explain what it does well. HMRC told us that its compliance work with high net worth individuals has been a success. Its approach to high net worth individuals has changed over time and it now appears to be taking a tougher line with those who break the rules. However, HMRC publishes little information about the approaches it takes or the number of criminal investigations and prosecutions in progress. The lack of transparency leaves the Department open to the perception that, in its dealings with taxpayers, there is one rule for the rich and another for everyone else. This is reinforced by the income tax paid by high net worth individuals having fallen from {\pounds}4.4 billion in 2009–10 to {\pounds}3.5 billion in 2014–15. We welcome the new Accounting Officer's commitment to greater transparency and his intention to expand the range of information HMRC publishes. However we are concerned that HMRC could not explain why income tax receipts from high net worth individuals has fallen by {\pounds}1 billion (20%) since 2009–10, while income tax from all taxpayers has increased by {\pounds}23 billion (9%) over the same period. Recommendations: HMRC should publish more information about its work generally alongside its next annual report and at regular intervals thereafter. We would expect the information to include: descriptions of key areas of its work, such as its approaches to tackling non-compliance and prosecutions; annual data on its operations, such as the number of criminal investigations in progress; and, progress updates on areas of public interest, such as its actions to investigate the data leaked in the Panama Papers. HMRC should include the information in its next annual report. In its response to this report HMRC should explain how income tax receipts have fallen by {\pounds}1 billion for high net worth individuals while income tax paid overall has increased by {\pounds}23 billion.},

First, respondents dramatically underestimated the current level of wealth inequality. Second, respondents constructed ideal wealth distributions that were far more equitable than even their erroneously low estimates of the actual distribution. Most important from a policy perspective, we observed a surprising level of consensus: All demographic groups—even those not usually associated with wealth redistribution such as Republicans and the wealthy—desired a more equal distribution of wealth than the status quo.},

@techreport{Baumberg2012,
abstract = {This report set out to investigate the stigma attached to claiming benefits in Britain today, using an original MORI survey conducted in May 2012, focus groups with claimants and non-claimants, re-analysis of existing survey data, and an analysis of articles about benefits in national newspapers from 1995 to 2011. We use ‘stigma' throughout this report as a term to describe the idea that a characteristic – in this case claiming benefits – is seen to be embarrassing or shameful and to lead to a lower social status. We argue that benefits are primarily stigmatised when they are seen as an undeserved and unreciprocated gift. • To look at the extent to which claimants were seen as deserving, we examined public estimates of the proportion of claimants seen as ‘claiming falsely' or ‘committing fraud'. We found that the public vastly overestimate these numbers. • Evidence from surveys suggests that people now see claimants as less deserving than they did 20 years ago, with some changes happening in the late 1990s and others in the early 2000s. • The media is often blamed for levels of stigma in Britain. Our analysis of media coverage of benefits in national newspapers from 1995 to 2011 found that while newspapers contain both positive and negative representations of claimants, the content of press stories is indeed skewed towards negative representations. • It is sometimes stated that coverage has become ‘more negative' over recent years. Over the longer term we find that negative coverage in 2010/11 was at about the same level as in the late 1990s, an earlier period of intense media coverage of benefits. • However both the language and content of ‘negative' coverage have changed substantially over time. While fraud remains very important in negative coverage, articles are much more likely now to refer to lack of reciprocity and effort on the part of claimants than they were previously. • Our detailed analysis of survey evidence and media coverage – coupled with an experiment in our commissioned survey – supports the idea that negative media coverage is linked to stigma. • There is often little evidence on which people can judge whether claimants are ‘deserving' on casual acquaintance. Our survey shows that less than a third of disabled claimants think their disability would be obvious to others on meeting them. Prior attitudes, influenced amongst other things by political beliefs and media coverage, seem to affect the extent to which claimants are perceived as deservingor undeserving in everyday life. • The other links between personal experience and stigma are complex, but we found no evidence of a ‘dependency culture' in which those living in areas where more people claim benefits experience less stigma. • International evidence suggests that countries with benefit systems based on contribution or on citizenship, rather than on a means tested basis, are less likely to see high levels of benefits stigma. • Quantitative and qualitative evidence suggests that stigma is playing a role in explaining non-take-up of benefits and tax credits, with around one in four respondents to the MORI survey giving at least one stigma-related reason for delaying or not claiming. 4 • Focus group participants report a clear negative impact of stigma on feelings of self worth. • Evidence about the success of tax credits in reducing the stigma attached to claiming financial support suggests that we can change levels of stigma in Britain. The report therefore concludes with recommendations on the design of the benefits system; benefits delivery; the media; and public messages about benefits. 5},

abstract = {This book vindicates the commonsense idea that the right to property is a right to things. Distinguishing between the ‘practice' of property and the ‘practice' of contract is essential for a proper understanding, but failure to do so is common. As the book shows, it mars both John Locke's and Georg Hegel's philosophies of property, and continues to contribute to confusion. It also obscures the central element of sharing and giving in the ownership of property, the importance of which has been generally neglected. Perhaps most controversially, the book argues that the justification of the right to property is not dependent on the justice of the reigning distribution of property — that is a question which concerns the justice of the economy (gift, command, market, or mixed) — that distributes all values, not just rights in property. The important ‘distributional' question about property is this: to what values does the property practice apply? Why does it apply to castles and cars, books and bank balances, but not to our body parts and our labour, nor to our employment contracts and our sexuality? To address these issues the book develops a distinction between persons and our personality-rich relationships that cannot be objects of property, and ‘things', both land and objects and personality-poor relationships like debts, which can.},

abstract = {Richard Wilkinson's ‘inequality hypothesis' describes the relationship between societal income inequality and population health in terms of the corrosive psychosocial effects of social hierarchy. An explicit component of this hypothesis is that inequality should lead individuals to become more competitive and self-focused, less friendly and altruistic. Together these traits are a close conceptual match to the opposing poles of the Big Five personality factor of Agreeableness; a widely used concept in the field of personality psychology. Based on this fact, we predicted that individuals living in more economically unequal U.S. states should be lower in Agreeableness than those living in more equal states. This hypothesis was tested in both ecological and multilevel analyses in the 50 states plus Washington DC, using a large Internet sample (N = 674,885). Consistent with predictions, ecological and multilevel models both showed a negative relationship between state level inequality and Agreeableness. These relationships were not explained by differences in average income, overall state socio-demographic composition or individual socio-demographic characteristics.},

We found a significant reduction in hospitalization, especially for admissions related to mental health and to accidents and injuries, relative to the matched comparison group. Physician contacts for mental health diagnoses fell relative to the comparison group. A greater proportion of high school students continued on to grade 12. We found no increase in fertility, no increase in family dissolution rates and no improvement in birth outcomes. Our results document the value of health administration data for historical analysis, and demonstrate that a relatively modest GAI can improve population health suggesting the possibility of health system savings.},

abstract = {The paper documents the significant changes of ownership since the infrastructure utilities were privatized and, in particular, the shifts from the initial focus on dispersed retail share ownership through takeovers to more concentrated ownership and the emergence of private equity and infrastructure funds. In the process, there has been substantial financial engineering and balance sheets have been geared up towards exhaustion, with major implications for financing future investment. Increased gearing has, on the one hand, introduced the discipline of debt upon management which had engaged in substantive diversification, and on the other provided an arbitrage between the weighted average cost of capital used to calculate the allowed return, and the lower marginal cost of debt. The paper shows how regulation has determined the allocation of risk, and facilitated the observed changes in ownership and financial structures. Three solutions to the exhausted balance sheets are considered to finance future investment: rate-of-return regulation; the split cost of capital; and a collapse back into not-for-dividend, mutual or state ownership. The default outcome already witnessed in the Welsh Water and Network Rail cases is the latter case, which is inferior to the second option.},

abstract = {Notes for the keynote lecture at the inaugural conference of the Zurich Center for Economic Development, 12/12/2016 Why have me deliver the keynote at a taxation in developing countries (DC) conference? I am not a development economist, having worked on tax issues only in Mexico, Colombia, and Egypt. But for the past 25 years I have been working on aspects of tax systems that are particularly important in developing countries: tax evasion, enforcement, and administration. Be that as it may, I am very pleased to be able to address this conference, and am very disappointed I could not attend this conference. I am especially pleased because this conference is evidence that taxation in DCs has attracted the attention of some of the brightest minds among young economists studying public finance. You represent a new wave. For decades many economists have studied the fiscal challenges faced by DCs, bringing sound economics reasoning and a wealth of global experience to bear. I have in mind people like Richard Bird of the University of Toronto, who devoted his career to finding sensible tax structures and procedures that can be implemented with the administrative capabilities found in DCs. Economists such as Richard recommended that tax policy be adopted to the realities of the environment, including severely limited administrative resources. Forget what the textbooks tell you, he might say, a VAT as it really works in a DC is not a uniform consumption tax given rampant evasion, chains of untaxed firms , collection most effective at the border, and so on. What then, is it? Consider seriously, he might say, implementing a presumptive income tax, where tax liability for small businesses depends not on a difficult-to-verify calculation of profit but instead on more easily measured quantities such as, for restaurants, the number of tables, the seating area, and the neighborhood. And, let's not be condescending about DC tax systems. Tax systems in rich countries have many presumptive elements, such as arbitrary standard depreciation schedules, standard deductions, and taxation of realized capital gains. All of these are compromises from a theoretically ideal income tax base done largely for practical reasons. But for all his many insights and contributions, economists like Richard did not apply modern public finance techniques, neither optimal taxation reasoning nor state-of-the-art empirical methods. And so we could not rigorously ask, for example, when it makes sense to exempt small firms from taxation, sacrificing production efficiency to save administrative costs—and what data would inform this policy choice. We could not rigorously investigate what is the},

When setting the rate of tax, it is argued that land used for generating an income should be distinguished from that which is merely part of a person's home. For owner-occupied residential properties, it is proposed that it be set initially at a low rate, collecting comparable revenue to that currently collected by Council Tax. For larger owner-occupied houses, it is proposed that a parallel buildings tax be introduced. For commercial and industrial properties, it is proposed that the LVT be set at a higher rate, such that it collects the same amount of revenue as that currently collected by the National Non-Domestic Rates. It is also argued that the same higher rate be applied to rented residential properties, payable not by the occupier, but by the landowner, on the grounds that it is land used for generating an income. Finally, it is argued that owners of derelict land or brownfield sites, and land banks, should also be charged LVT to encourage development of land for public benefit.},

abstract = {This paper argues against the common-sense conclusion that climate change demands a global market-based solution, such as international emissions trading. First, current experience suggests global cooperation is not necessary for initial mandatory actions. Second, when domestic targets vary across nations, there are a variety of reasons why international emissions trading, even though it creates aggregate economic gains for all nations, may not be desirable. These reasons include concerns over legitimizing target variations for future negotiations, real and perceived consequences of capital flows across nations, and distributional impacts within nations. Finally, the underlying need for global technology solutions suggests domestic mitigation policies that balance clear emissions price signals, incentives for technology development and deployment, and mechanisms to finance deployment to developing countries. International efforts, in turn, might focus on encouraging these domestic actions, facilitating the developing country investment mechanisms, and providing credible reviews of national action.},

@article{GeorgeH.K.WangandJotYau,
abstract = {In the wake of the recent financial crisis, several commentators have suggested a transaction tax on financial markets. The potential consequences of such a tax could be hazardous to the financial markets affected as well as to the economy. In this paper, we review the relevant theoretical and empirical literature and apply our findings to estimate the possible impact of a transaction tax on U.S. futures market activity as well as its utility as potential tax revenue. We find that the impact of a transaction tax on market activity (trading volume, bid-ask spread, and price volatility) will determine the potential of such a tax as a source of government revenue. We also find that the current estimated elasticity of trading volume with respect to a transaction tax in the U.S. futures markets is much higher than those reported in the extant literature and those used by the government in such computation. We show that a transaction tax on futures trading will not only fail to generate the expected tax revenue, it will likely drive business away from U.S. exchanges and toward untaxed foreign markets. A review of the literature and estimates contained here indicates that there is an inverse relationship between transaction cost (bid-ask spread) and trading volume; to the extent that a transaction tax increases costs, trading volumes will likely fall. There is also a positive relationship between transaction cost and price volatility, suggesting that the imposition of a transaction tax could actually increase financial market fragility, increasing the likelihood of a financial crisis rather than reducing it. Perversely, the imposition of a financial transaction tax could have results that are exactly the opposite of those hoped for by its proponents.},

@article{SullivanCromwellLLP2011,
abstract = {A Comparison of the New Levies on Banks SUMMARY The United Kingdom, France and Germany have all recently finalised, or are in the process of finalising, details of their respective bank levies. This memorandum compares the salient features of each bank levy. Four main differences may be outlined in summary. The first difference is the computation of the basis for each levy. The United Kingdom and Germany have adopted a similar approach, taking into account total equity and liabilities subject to certain exceptions, e.g., for minimum regulatory capital. By contrast, the French bank levy is based on minimum regulatory capital. Even though both aggregates are clearly related in the banking industry, the different bases of each levy make it difficult to directly compare the financial burden on banks in each country. Second, the aim of the German levy is to create a dedicated restructuring fund to be drawn upon in the event of financial crisis, whereas the proceeds of the United Kingdom levy and the French levy will feed into general revenues. Third, France and the United Kingdom will tax banks or banking groups resident in their respective jurisdictions on a worldwide/consolidated basis, while the German bank levy is computed on a standalone basis. Fourth, rules with respect to double taxation relief are not yet harmonised. French domestic rules provide for a tax credit granted to non-French banks carrying out banking operations in France through a taxable branch or taxable subsidiaries but this relief is subject to a reciprocity condition. In the United Kingdom, double taxation relief remains subject to the negotiation of specific agreements with relevant countries or to the enactment of specific regulations in this respect. As the German bank levy is structured as a levy and not as a tax, it is not entirely clear whether double taxation relief will be available, and certain characteristics of the German bank levy are subject to the issue of the relevant ordinance (the " German Ordinance ") which is still in draft form dated March 2, 2011. This memorandum does not provide a detailed description of the characteristics of each bank levy. For further information, please refer in},

Environmental taxes have been widely introduced across Europe and 
elsewhere over the last 20 years. Many organisations have advocated a 
more widespread or radical adoption of green taxes. But what evidence is 
there that green taxes are actually effective? Indeed, what do we mean by 
effectiveness, how can it be assessed, and what are the factors that affect 
it?  
This briefing looks at these issues and draws conclusions from the review of 
evidence that the Green Fiscal Commission has conducted on the practical 
effectiveness of green taxes, particularly in relation to their reduction of 
environmental impacts. We conclude that, where environmental taxes have 
been evaluated, the evidence is overwhelming that they are an effective 
means of reducing environmental impacts. Some green taxes will also 
generate tax revenues for government which are stable over time. This 
briefing also highlights some important factors that contribute to the 
effectiveness of green taxes.},

abstract = {In the postwar era, developed economies have experienced two substantial trends in the net capital share of aggregate income: a rise during the last several decades, which is well known, and a fall of comparable magnitude that continued until the 1970s, which is less well known. Overall, the net capital share has increased since 1948, but once disaggregated this increase turns out to come entirely from the housing sector: the contribution to net capital income from all other sectors has been zero or slightly negative, as the fall and rise have offset each other. Several influential accounts of the recent rise emphasize the role of increased capital accumulation, but this view is at odds with theory and evidence: it requires empirically improbable elasticities of substitution, and it presumes a correlation between the capital-income ratio and capital share that is not visible in the data. A more limited narrative that stresses scarcity and the increased cost of housing better fits the data. These results are clarified using a new, multisector model of factor shares.},

The dataset contains over 50 new global maps containing high-resolution information for understanding the multiple roles (biophysical, economic, social) that livestock can play in different parts of the world. The dataset highlights: (i) feed efficiency as a key driver of productivity, resource use, and greenhouse gas emission intensities, with vast differences between production systems and animal products; (ii) the importance of grasslands as a global resource, supplying almost 50% of biomass for animals while continuing to be at the epicentre of land conversion processes; and (iii) the importance of mixed crop–livestock systems, producing the greater part of animal production (over 60%) in both the developed and the developing world.

abstract = {Construction of a multidisciplinary conceptual framework of environmental quality and quality of life is required to advance the field of urban development, environmental quality and human well-being. Such a framework would allow for a more theory-based choice of indicators and for the development of tools to evaluate multidimensional aspects of urban environmental quality. These tools are required to assess the current and future quality of the urban environment and to have, eventually, the ability to assess the implications of spatial and urban planning policies with respect to these dimensions. Against this background, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands (RIVM) performed a major literature review [Leidelmeijer, van Kamp, 2002, in press] to identify various concepts in the literature concerning environmental quality, the relationships between these various concepts, as well as their respective theoretical bases. This paper summarises the outcomes of this survey. It reviews the main (types of) concepts of livability, environmental quality, quality of life and sustainability, and presents examples of underlying conceptual models. Different notions and concepts are compared along the dimensions of domain, indicator, scale, time-frame and context as described by [Urban Environmental Quality—a social geographical perspective, this issue]. It is concluded that a multidisciplinary conceptual framework of environmental quality and quality of life that will go beyond the disciplinary differences found in the current literature is needed if the field is to advance.},

@article{Haber2011,
abstract = {A large body of scholarship finds a negative relationship between natural resources and democracy. Extant cross-country regressions, however, assume random effects and are run on panel datasets with relatively short time dimensions. Because natural resource reliance is not an exogenous variable, this is not an effective strategy for uncovering causal relationships. Numerous sources of bias may be driving the results, the most serious of which is omitted variable bias induced by unobserved country-specific and time-invariant heterogeneity. To address these problems, we develop unique histori-cal datasets, employ time-series centric techniques, and operationalize explicitly specified counterfactuals. We test to see if there is a long-run relationship between resource reliance and regime type within countries over time, both on a country-by-country basis and across several different panels. We find that increases in resource reliance are not associated with authoritarianism. In fact, in many specifications we generate results that suggest a resource blessing. A substantial political economy literature argues that economic and fiscal reliance on petroleum, natural gas, and minerals helps create and per-petuate authoritarian political regimes. The genesis of this idea can be found in Mahdavy (1970), who noted that petroleum revenues in Middle Eastern countries constituted an external source of rents directly cap-tured by governments, thereby rendering them unac-countable to citizens. Other scholars then built upon Mahdavy (1970) to postulate a general law about},

abstract = {Most taxes nowadays are levied on flows of income and of expenditure. But land and property have been taxed for centuries—certainly for longer than income—and they continue to form an important part of the tax base in most advanced economies. There are good economic reasons for this. The supply of property, and especially land, is not very responsive to its price, which means that it can be taxed without significantly distorting people's behaviour. The ownership of land is also generally visible and easily established, which makes it relatively straightforward to identify who should be paying the tax. The fact that land and property have identifiable and unchangeable geographic locations also makes them natural tax bases for the financing of local government. But deciding exactly how to tax land and property is particularly complex, because they combine a number of characteristics that each suggest different tax treatments. Take a house. It sits on land, the value of which we might want to tax because the land is completely fixed and the return to it is an economic rent. But the house also provides services that are consumed by the occupier—just as a fridge or a car does. So it is natural to think that the value of this consumption should be subject to VAT. The house is also a valuable asset, whose value rises and fluctuates like those of stocks and shares. So we might see homeownership as a form of saving that should be taxed consistently with other savings. Also important is the distinction between owner-occupied and rented property. Ideally, we would want to treat these consistently. But, at present, their tax treatments are quite different in the UK, providing a clear bias towards owner-occupation. The Taxation of Land and Property 369 Business property also combines characteristics that suggest different tax treatments. We would ideally like to tax the commercial use of land consistently with other uses, while treating the property built on it consistently with other inputs into the production process. To understand how to tax land and property, it is important to keep these issues and themes distinct. To be clear: • Land, whether used for business or residential property, can be taxed at an},

Why didn't industrialization make the whole world rich--and why did it make large parts of the world even poorer? In A Farewell to Alms, Gregory Clark tackles these profound questions and suggests a new and provocative way in which culture--not exploitation, geography, or resources--explains the wealth, and the poverty, of nations. Countering the prevailing theory that the Industrial Revolution was sparked by the sudden development of stable political, legal, and economic institutions in seventeenth-century Europe, Clark shows that such institutions existed long before industrialization. He argues instead that these institutions gradually led to deep cultural changes by encouraging people to abandon hunter-gatherer instincts-violence, impatience, and economy of effort-and adopt economic habits-hard work, rationality, and education. The problem, Clark says, is that only societies that have long histories of settlement and security seem to develop the cultural characteristics and effective workforces that enable economic growth. For the many societies that have not enjoyed long periods of stability, industrialization has not been a blessing. Clark also dissects the notion, championed by Jared Diamond in Guns, Germs, and Steel, that natural endowments such as geography account for differences in the wealth of nations. A brilliant and sobering challenge to the idea that poor societies can be economically developed through outside intervention, A Farewell to Alms may change the way global economic history is understood.},

Is it higher than the growth rate of the economy and, if so, by how much? Is there a tendency for returns to fall in the long-run? Which particular assets have the highest long-run returns? We answer these questions on the basis of a new and comprehensive dataset for all major asset classes, including—for the first time—total returns to the largest, but oft ignored, component of household wealth, housing. The annual data on total returns for equity, housing, bonds, and bills cover 16 advanced economies from 1870 to 2015, and our new evidence reveals many new insights and puzzles.},

This paper articulates different notions of double dividend and examines the theoretical and empirical evidence for each. It also connects the double-dividend issue with principles of optimal environmental taxation in a second-best setting. A weak double-dividend claim-that returning tax revenues through cuts in distortionary taxes leads to cost savings relative to the case where revenues are returned lump sum-is easily defended on theoretical grounds and (thankfully) receives wide support from numerical simulations. The stronger versions contend that revenueneutral swaps of environmental taxes for ordinary distortionary taxes involve zero or negative gross costs. Theoretical analyses and numerical results tend to cast doubt on the strong double-dividend claim, although the theoretical case is not air-tight and the numerical evidence is mixed.},

abstract = {This paper reports the first findings from a project that examines the extent to which different social groups find their policy preferences reflected in actual government policy and the variation in these patterns across time and policy domains. For example, when Americans with low and high incomes disagree, are policy outcomes more likely to reflect the preferences of affluent Americans? If so, does the advantage of more affluent Americans differ over time (e.g., depending on which party controls the congress and presidency) or across policy domains? The larger project includes approximately 1,800 survey questions about possible changes in U.S. government policy administered between 1981 and 2002. In this paper I use data on public preferences and policy outcomes based on the subset of 754 national survey questions from 1992 through 1998. I find that when Americans with different income levels differ in their policy preferences, actual policy outcomes strongly reflect the preferences of the most affluent but bear virtually no relationship to the preferences of poor or middle income Americans. The vast discrepancy I find in government responsiveness to citizens with different incomes stands in stark contrast to the ideal of political equality that Americans hold dear. Although perfect political equality is an unrealistic goal, representational biases of this magnitude call into question the very democratic character of our society.},

We examine how the environments of lower-class individuals can also promote greater compassionate responding-that is, concern for the suffering or well-being of others. In the present research, we investigate class-based differences in dispositional compassion and its activation in situations wherein others are suffering. Across studies, relative to their upper-class counterparts, lower-class individuals reported elevated dispositional compassion (Study 1), as well as greater self-reported compassion during a compassion-inducing video (Study 2) and for another person during a social interaction (Study 3). Lower-class individuals also exhibited heart rate deceleration-a physiological response associated with orienting to the social environment and engaging with others-during the compassion-inducing video (Study 2). We discuss a potential mechanism of class-based influences on compassion, whereby lower-class individuals' are more attuned to others' distress, relative to their upper-class counterparts.},

@article{Shavell2011,
abstract = {Since the writing of A. C. Pigou (1932), taxes have been emphasized as a means of control of activities that generate harm, especially in the domain of pollution, yet their use is in fact lim-ited (Robert N. Stavins 2003). In contrast, liabil-ity has great importance in reducing harm. Much of the vast terrain of accidents—from oil spills, to crane mishaps, to car collisions—is subject to liability but not to taxation. I here compare cor-rective taxation to liability in two versions of a model, with a view toward shedding light on the difference in their application. 1 In the first version, the danger from an injurer's activity depends on factors that vary among injurers. For example, the probabil-ity and seriousness of an oil spill due to an oil tanker accident will depend on the strength of the tanker's hull and the vulnerability of fishing activity and tourism to a spill; and the expected harm from a crane accident will depend on char-acteristics of the crane and the exposure to risk of nearby buildings and passersby. I assume that it is impractical for the tax to be based on many such variables and for simplicity that the tax is a function only of an injurer's level of activity (amount of oil transported, number of uses of a crane). Hence, the tax will not induce injurers to choose their levels of activity optimally.},

This paper assesses the conditions under which rebating environmental levies is justified for the regulated sector, combining a theoretical approach with numerical simulations parameterized to reflect the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Rebates are undesired if one can instead tax the production of the unregulated sector. Otherwise, rebating is justified only when the goods of the competing sectors are close substitutes with similar emissions profiles. Policy constraints are costly in terms of welfare and environmental effectiveness.},

abstract = {e classical economists treated land as distinct from capital: "land, labour and capital" were the three basic "factors of production". They were mutually exclusive. They were comprehensive, including all economic agents. Each was also "limitational," meaning at least some of each was needed for all economic activity (v. A-9, below)" They made a coherent system. Neo-classical economists denied the distinction and undertook to purge land from economese. Many of them, following John B. Clark and Frank Knight, still deny the distinction as I explain in The Corruption of Economics, a companion volume in this series. Many treat the matter by seizing on and stressing all similarities of land and capital, while ignoring all differences. Some invent gray areas that seem to fuse land and capital, present them as typical, and quickly move on. Many more simply ignore land, which has the effect of accepting the Clark-Knight verdict in practice. Others uneasily finesse and blur the issue by writing "land" in quotes, or trivializing its value, or referring vaguely to "quasi-rents" to comprehend a broad spectrum of incomes both from land and other factors. Whatever possessed the neo-classicals to leave such a mess? One needs to know something of their times and politics. J.B. Clark and E.R.A.},

Of special interest in this context are welfare spill over and competitiveness effects resulting from diverse climate policy strategies. This study elaborates and compares multi-gas policy strategies and explores the impacts of sink inclusion. We furthermore examine the economic impacts on all world regions of the USA's non-cooperative, free rider position resulting from its recent isolated climate policy strategy decision. It turns out that CDM and JI show evidence of improvement in the economic development in host countries and increase the share of new applied technologies. The decomposition of welfare effects demonstrates that the competitiveness effect (including the spill over effects from trade) have the greatest importance because of the intense trade relations between countries. Climatic effects will have a significant impact within the next 50 years, will cause considerable welfare losses to world regions and will intensify if nations highly responsible for pollution like the USA do not reduce their emissions.},

abstract = {The 1966 Report of the Royal Commission on Taxation, 1 established with a sweeping mandate to examine the federal tax laws of Canada and to make recommendations for their improvement, has few peers among modern proposals for income tax reform. Its only rivals in this country are the two collections of tax reform proposals assembled in 1955 and 1959 by the Joint Economic Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, which could range more speculatively over the tax landscape because they consisted of separate papers submitted by a medley of experts, but which for the same reason lacked the cohesiveness that marks the Canadian Commission's program. The 1953-1955 reports of the British Royal Commission on the Taxation of Profits and Income are of comparable interest and quality, but they lack the boldness of the Canadian report, and at points require such a familiarity with the details of the United Kingdom's existing income tax law as to dis-courage the outsider. The only other comparable projects with which I am familiar are the 1949 recommendations of the Shoup Mission for the reform of the Japanese tax system and Nicholas Kaldor's 1954 pre-scription for India; neither has received the attention it deserves, the former having been discounted because of its military sponsorship and the latter because of an assumption that a plan devised for India would inevitably be destined for exhibition rather than use and hence would not have to be anchored in reality. The talent contributing to the American Law Institute's Federal Income Tax Project of the early 1950's could have produced a landmark of analysis and innovation, but its objective was "an improvement of the technical provisions of the present income tax statute" and it was faithful to this limited commit-ment. 2 Boris I.

@article{Three2009,
abstract = {Summary 
What does the public think about a green tax shift? Most recent opinion
polling about green taxes has presented the taxes as additional, rather than
part of a shift with green taxes offset by lowering other taxes, and has found
majorities of people opposed. The Green Fiscal Commission has had polling
done on public attitudes to a green tax shift and found that there were
large majorities in favour of such a shift. Majorities were in favour of shifts of
taxes to aviation, motoring and household energy offset with reductions in
other taxes.  
The Commission held deliberative events to explore the issue with members
of the public in much greater detail and from these found that there was
conditional public support for green fiscal reform. On the one hand, there
was approval for the principles of green taxation and recognition that fiscal
mechanisms were effective at changing behaviour. On the other, when
specific interventions were explored in depth, participants became
concerned around the fairness of environmental taxes in certain instances.  
If a programme of green fiscal reform is to be taken forward there is
therefore a need to motivate people about the importance of climate
change, to overcome scepticism that other taxes would be reduced, to
effectively communicate the financial implications for households, and for
institutions - possibly new ones - to facilitate the transition to low-carbon 
lifestyles. We explore these issues in more detail in our conclusions.},

abstract = {This paper studies the incidence of bank levies that were recently introduced in several Euro-pean countries. Their main objective is to internalize the fiscal cost of banking crises. Using a variant of the Monti-Klein model, we predict that banks pass part of the tax burden onto borrowers by raising lending rates but that deposit rates usually do not respond to the levy. The magnitude of the pass-through depends on bank competition and capitalization. These predictions are tested and quantified using a panel dataset with balance sheet information of almost 3'000 EU banks: On average, we find that bank levies moderately raise lending rates and net interest margins but do not significantly affect deposit rates suggesting a pass-through to borrowers. Bank competition determines the magnitude of the pass-through: Increases of the lending rate are particularly large and economically significant in concentrated banking markets with a low intensity of competition. To a lesser extent, the capital structure of banks influences the incidence: Well capitalized banks are less exposed to the levy such that pass-through of the burden to customers is less pronounced or even vanishes.},

abstract = {Lower social class (or socioeconomic status) is associated with fewer resources, greater exposure to threat, and a reduced sense of personal control. Given these life circumstances, one might expect lower class individuals to engage in less prosocial behavior, prioritizing self-interest over the welfare of others. The authors hypothesized, by contrast, that lower class individuals orient to the welfare of others as a means to adapt to their more hostile environments and that this orientation gives rise to greater prosocial behavior. Across 4 studies, lower class individuals proved to be more generous (Study 1), charitable (Study 2), trusting (Study 3), and helpful (Study 4) compared with their upper class counterparts. Mediator and moderator data showed that lower class individuals acted in a more prosocial fashion because of a greater commitment to egalitarian values and feelings of compassion. Implications for social class, prosocial behavior, and economic inequality are discussed.},

Jobs and pay are being cut, benefits slashed and public services closed; small businesses are struggling to survive on our high streets. A simple part of the solution is to close the tax gap, which involves two things: making those most able pay their fair share of taxes and beating tax cheats. In 2010 PCS published the most comprehensive calculation of the UK tax gap undertaken at the time. The report by Tax Research UK estimated the tax gap at {\pounds}120 billion. This was made up of {\pounds}70 billion in evaded tax, {\pounds}25 billion in avoided tax and {\pounds}25 billion in tax paid late. At the time the government criticised this figure as being far too high and instead estimated a tax gap of {\pounds}35 billion in 2011/12. Campaigning by PCS, UK Uncut and others about the high profile tax avoidance activities of companies such as Google, Starbucks and Amazon along with celebrities like Jimmy Carr, Chris Moyles and Gary Barlow, have pushed the issue into the media spotlight.

This paper employs EUROMOD to study the initial losses that a variety of different Citizen's Income schemes would generate, and finds that in those schemes in which a Citizen's Income replaces most means-tested benefits, substantial household losses would occur, both generally and for households in the lowest disposable income decile, whereas where means-tested benefits are not abolished, but instead the Citizen's Income reduces means-tested benefits in the same way that other existing income does, almost no households in the lowest disposable income decile suffer initial losses, and initial losses generally are at a manageable level. This means that there is at least one method for implementing a Citizen's Income that could be politically attractive.},

We outline the existing taxation and carbon-reduction initiatives in the UK as candidates for simplification. Regarding land and property, we assess the value of existing UK land, dominated by location value; and provide a parables to what an economy dominated by land and property interests looks like. The concept of Systemic Fiscal Reform is introduced and the philosophical justification for such an approach outlined. Finally, we assess the predicted economic effects of a shift away from existing taxes towards taxes on resources, land and environmental damage.},

One of the major factors explaining this delay is that relevant investment decisions are based on market prices which do not reflect positive environmental impacts and other benefits associated with the exploitation of solar energy. This paper presents a cost benefit analysis for evaluating solar water heating systems in comparison with competitive conventional technologies in Greece. The major external benefits included in the analysis are energy saving, avoided environmental impact and job creation. The results show that in the specific Greek conditions, the use of solar collectors results in considerable net social benefits if substituted for electricity and Diesel but not for replacing natural gas.},

This paper presents a comparative analysis of the effect of learning and technical change in electricity generation technologies. We use simultaneous two-factor learning and diffusion models to estimate the effect of learning by doing and learning by research on technical progress for a range of technologies in four stages of development. We find learning patters broadly in line with the perceived view of technical progress. The results generally show higher learning by research than learning by doing rates. Moreover, we do not find any development stage where learning by doing is stronger than learning by research. We show that simple learning by doing curves overstate the effect of learning in particular for newer technologies. Finally, we find little substitution potential between learning by doing and research for most technologies.},

We use Earth's measured energy imbalance, paleoclimate data, and simple representations of the global carbon cycle and temperature to define emission reductions needed to stabilize climate and avoid potentially disastrous impacts on today's young people, future generations, and nature. A cumulative industrial-era limit of ∼500 GtC fossil fuel emissions and 100 GtC storage in the biosphere and soil would keep climate close to the Holocene range to which humanity and other species are adapted. Cumulative emissions of ∼1000 GtC, sometimes associated with 2°C global warming, would spur "slow" feedbacks and eventual warming of 3-4°C with disastrous consequences. Rapid emissions reduction is required to restore Earth's energy balance and avoid ocean heat uptake that would practically guarantee irreversible effects. Continuation of high fossil fuel emissions, given current knowledge of the consequences, would be an act of extraordinary witting intergenerational injustice. Responsible policymaking requires a rising price on carbon emissions that would preclude emissions from most remaining coal and unconventional fossil fuels and phase down emissions from conventional fossil fuels.},

A special emphasis is put on surveying and discussing, through the so-called learning curve, both studies estimating learning rates in the energy field and studies incorporating endogenous technological learning in bottom-up and top-down models. The survey of learning rate estimations gives special attention to interpreting and explaining the sources of variability of estimated rates, which is shown to be mainly inherent in R&D expenditures, the problem of omitted variable bias, the endogeneity relationship and the role of spillovers. Large-scale models survey show that, despite some methodological and computational complexity related to the non-linearity and the non-convexity associated with the learning curve incorporation, results of the numerous modelling experiments give several new insights with regard to the analysis of the prospects of specific technological options and their cost decrease potential (bottom-up models), and with regard to the analysis of strategic considerations, especially inherent in the innovation and energy diffusion process, in particular the energy sector's endogenous responses to environment policy instruments (top-down models).},

abstract = {Summary 
What does the public think about a green tax shift? Most recent opinion
polling about green taxes has presented the taxes as additional, rather than
part of a shift with green taxes offset by lowering other taxes, and has found
majorities of people opposed. The Green Fiscal Commission has had polling
done on public attitudes to a green tax shift and found that there were
large majorities in favour of such a shift. Majorities were in favour of shifts of
taxes to aviation, motoring and household energy offset with reductions in
other taxes.  
The Commission held deliberative events to explore the issue with members
of the public in much greater detail and from these found that there was
conditional public support for green fiscal reform. On the one hand, there
was approval for the principles of green taxation and recognition that fiscal
mechanisms were effective at changing behaviour. On the other, when
specific interventions were explored in depth, participants became
concerned around the fairness of environmental taxes in certain instances.  
If a programme of green fiscal reform is to be taken forward there is
therefore a need to motivate people about the importance of climate
change, to overcome scepticism that other taxes would be reduced, to
effectively communicate the financial implications for households, and for
institutions - possibly new ones - to facilitate the transition to low-carbon 
lifestyles. We explore these issues in more detail in our conclusions.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the evolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations throughout the Earth's history is important for a reconstruction of the links between climate and radiative forcing of the Earth's surface temperatures. Although atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the early Cenozoic era (about 60 Myr ago) are widely believed to have been higher than at present, there is disagreement regarding the exact carbon dioxide levels, the timing of the decline and the mechanisms that are most important for the control of CO2 concentrations over geological timescales. Here we use the boron-isotope ratios of ancient planktonic foraminifer shells to estimate the pH of surface-layer sea water throughout the past 60 million years, which can be used to reconstruct atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We estimate CO2 concentrations of more than 2,000 p.p.m. for the late Palaeocene and earliest Eocene periods (from about 60 to 52 Myr ago), and find an erratic decline between 55 and 40 Myr ago that may have been caused by reduced CO2 outgassing from ocean ridges, volcanoes and metamorphic belts and increased carbon burial. Since the early Miocene (about 24 Myr ago), atmospheric CO2 concentrations appear to have remained below 500 p.p.m. and were more stable than before, although transient intervals of CO2 reduction may have occurred during periods of rapid cooling approximately 15 and 3 Myr ago.},

The academic literature and policy documents have in recent years embraced the learning curves and applied the concept to technology analysis and forecasting cost reductions. We argue that learning curves have often been used or assumed uncritically in technology analysis and draw parallels between the use of learning rates in energy technological progress and climate change modeling to that of discount rates in social cost benefit analysis. The paper discusses that care needs to be taken in applying learning curves, originally developed as an empirical tool to assess the effect of learning by doing in manufacturing, to analysis innovation and technical change. Finally, we suggest some potential extensions of learning curves, e.g. by incorporating R&D and diffusion effects into learning models, and other areas where learning curves may potentially be a useful tool in energy technology policy and analysis.},

@article{Hansen2007,
abstract = {Palaeoclimate data show that the Earth's climate is remarkably sensitive to global forcings. Positive feedbacks predominate. This allows the entire planet to be whipsawed between climate states. One feedback, the 'albedo flip' property of ice/water, provides a powerful trigger mechanism. A climate forcing that 'flips' the albedo of a sufficient portion of an ice sheet can spark a cataclysm. Inertia of ice sheet and ocean provides only moderate delay to ice sheet disintegration and a burst of added global warming. Recent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions place the Earth perilously close to dramatic climate change that could run out of our control, with great dangers for humans and other creatures. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the largest human-made climate forcing, but other trace constituents are also important. Only intense simultaneous efforts to slow CO2 emissions and reduce non-CO2 forcings can keep climate within or near the range of the past million years. The most important of the non-CO2 forcings is methane (CH4), as it causes the second largest human-made GHG climate forcing and is the principal cause of increased tropospheric ozone (O3), which is the third largest GHG forcing. Nitrous oxide (N2O) should also be a focus of climate mitigation efforts. Black carbon ('black soot') has a high global warming potential (approx. 2000, 500 and 200 for 20, 100 and 500 years, respectively) and deserves greater attention. Some forcings are especially effective at high latitudes, so concerted efforts to reduce their emissions could preserve Arctic ice, while also having major benefits for human health, agricultural productivity and the global environment.},

abstract = {This paper describes results from a model of decision-making under uncertainty using a real options methodology, developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The model represents investment decisions in power generation from the perspective of a private company. The investments are subject to uncertain future climate policy, which is treated as an external risk factor over which the company has no control. The aims of this paper are to (i) quantify these regulatory risks in order to improve understanding of how policy uncertainty may affect investment behaviour by private companies and (ii) illustrate the effectiveness of the real options approach as a policy analysis tool. The study analysed firms' investment options of coal- and gas-fired power plants and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Policy uncertainty is represented as an exogenous event that creates uncertainty in the carbon price. Our findings indicate that climate policy uncertainty creates a risk premium for power generation investments. In the case of gas- and coal-fired power generation, the risk premium would lead to an increase in electricity prices of 5-10% in order to stimulate investment. In the case of CCS, the risk premium would increase the carbon price required to stimulate investment by 16-37% compared to a situation of perfect certainty. The option to retrofit CCS acts as a hedge against high future carbon prices, and could accelerate investment in coal plant. This paper concludes that to minimise investment risks in low carbon technologies, policy-makers should aim to provide some long-term regulatory certainty.},

abstract = {The shadow price, or ‘social cost', of carbon is an important indicator of the global incremental damage done by emitting greenhouse gases today. Cost–benefit analysis would set the optimal amount of greenhouse-gas-emission reduction at the point where this social cost just equals the incremental cost of controlling emissions. The higher the value for the social cost of carbon, the more control is warranted. This comparison assumes that cost–benefit analysis is the correct way of determining climate-change policy, and many believe this is not the case because of the very long-term, irreversible, and potentially catastrophic nature of global warming. But, in the short run at least, a comparison of cost and benefits is required, and, in any event, all decisions imply costs and benefits. But what is the ‘right' figure for the social cost of carbon? This paper reviews the UK government's assessment of the cost and concludes that it has been set far too high because of a misreading of the integrated assessment models used to balance costs and benefits. Moreover, adoption of the UK government's shadow price would have formidable implications for energy policy in the UK, and for policies on afforestation.},

The Kyoto Protocol does not fare well on a number of criteria, but none of the alternative proposals fare well along all six dimensions. We identify several major themes among the alternative proposals: Kyoto is "too little, too fast"; developing countries (DCs) should play a more substantial role and receive incentives to participate; implementation should focus on market-based approaches, especially those with price mechanisms; and participation and compliance incentives are inadequately addressed by most proposals. Our investigation reveals tensions among several of the evaluative criteria, such as between environmental outcome and efficiency, and between cost-effectiveness and incentives for participation and compliance.},

Retrospective analysis of the Stern Review (2007) suggests that the risks were underestimated, indicating a stabilization target closer to 450 ppm CO2e. Climate policy at the international level is now moving rapidly towards agreeing an emissions pathway, and distributing responsibilities between countries. A feasible framework can be constructed in which each country takes on its own responsibilities and targets, based on a shared understanding of the risks and the need for action and collaboration on climate change. The global deal should contain six key features: (i) a pathway to achieve the world target of 50 per cent reductions by 2050, where rich countries contribute at least 75 per cent of the reductions; (ii) global emissions trading to reduce costs; (iii) reform of the clean development mechanism to scale up emission reductions on a sectoral or benchmark level; (iv) scaling up of R&D funding for low-carbon energy; (v) an agreement on deforestation; and (vi) adaptation finance.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new optimal design method for building energy systems is proposed. This method provides the most efficient energy system, best combination of equipment capacity and best operational planning for cooling, heating, and power simultaneously with respect to certain criteria such as energy consumption, CO2 emission, etc. Specifically for this paper, the authors apply this method to a sample building as a case study. The "Genetic Algorithms (GA)" optimization method, which can resolve nonlinear optimization problems, is adopted for this optimization analysis. Also its applicability is analyzed in a case study. In order to validate the accuracy of this method, the correct optimum solution based on comprehensive inquiries is also calculated. A comparison of the GA solution with the correct solution demonstrates fairly good agreement. The results show that the proposed method is sufficiently capable of determining the optimal design and has the potential to be applied to very complex energy systems with appropriate modifications.},

abstract = {The major purpose of the present study is to understand the performance of an integrated photovoltaic and thermal solar system (IPVTS) as compared to a conventional solar water heater and to demonstrate the idea of an IPVTS design. A commercial polycrystalline PV module is used for making a PV/T collector. The PV/T collector is used to build an IPVTS. The test results show that the solar PV/T collector made from a corrugated polycarbonate panel can obtain a good thermal efficiency. The present study introduces the concept of primary-energy saving efficiency for the evaluation of a PV/T system. The primary-energy saving efficiency of the present IPVTS exceeds 0.60. This is higher than for a pure solar hot water heater or a pure PV system. The characteristic daily efficiency [eta]s* reaches 0.38 which is about 76% of the value for a conventional solar hot water heater using glazed collectors ([eta]s*=0.50). The performance of a PV/T collector can be improved if the heat-collecting plate, the PV cells and the glass cover are directly packed together to form a glazed collector. The manufacturing cost of the PV/T collector and the system cost of the IPVTS can also be reduced. The present study shows that the idea of IPVTS is economically feasible too.},

@article{Johnson2007,
abstract = {Regulatory instruments for greenhouse gas control present a policy dilemma: Market-based instruments such as cap and trade function to reduce regulatory costs; but because they provide no guarantee that costs will be reduced to acceptable levels it is infeasible to set caps at sustainable levels. Emission taxes provide cost certainty, but their comparatively high cost makes it infeasible to set tax rates at levels commensurate with sustainability goals. However, there is a straightforward solution to this dilemma: Just as cap and trade uses free allowance allocation to minimize regulatory costs, an emission tax's cost can be mitigated by refunding tax revenue in such a way that emission reduction becomes profitable. A refunded tax, like cap and trade with free allocation, would be revenue-neutral within the regulated industry. Marginal competitive incentives for commercializing emission-reducing technologies would not be diminished by the refund, and the refund could actually make it politically and economically feasible to increase the incentives by an order of magnitude. Whereas cap and trade merely caps emissions at an unsustainable level while subjecting the economy to extreme price volatility, refunded emission taxes could create a stable investment environment with sustained incentives for emission reduction over a long-term investment horizon.},

@article{Barker1993,
abstract = {A carbon/energy tax has been proposed by the European Commission to start as US$3 per barrel oil equivalent in 1993, rising to US$10 in 2000. The effects of this tax on the UK economy can be assessed by using a large-scale energy-environment-economy model in which energy demand is treated by means of aggregate equations for energy users and fuel share equations for electricity and each of the main fossil fuels. The electricity supply industry is represented in the model by simulating the characteristics of each existing generating station and of a range of new station types, and by allowing the model to choose the fuels used from relative fuel prices and prices of capital inputs. This approach contrasts with the multimodel approach used in most studies of the effects of the tax. The tax is introduced as a tax on imports and domestic output of fossil fuels in proportion to their carbon and energy content, with the tax being passed on through the economic system depending on the use of the fuels. Thus the electricity industry is faced with higher prices for coal, gas and fuel oil and chooses to burn the different fuels according to their relative prices. Four scenarios are developed, which vary according to the way the tax revenues are recycled through reductions in VAT or in income tax rates and whether the tax is introduced throughout the European Community or throughout the OECD. If the tax is European, it is assumed that the energy intensive industries will be exempt. The outcome is that the tax is sufficient to stabilize CO2 emissions over the period 1990-2005, at 12% below base levels by the end of the period. There is an overall saving of energy compared to base and a further switch to gas in electricity generation. The effects on the macroeconomy are rather small, and as the revenues are recycled, rather than saved by the government, GDP growth is likely to increase under the tax by some 0.2% above base. This confirms other studies in which revenues are recycled, but contradicts many results from studies in which revenue recycling is ignored or incomplete. The effects on the energy intensive industries are expected to be small in all the scenarios, but 14% of tax revenues are lost if the industries are exempt.},

CDA is a regression-based method in which the regression attributes consumption to end-uses on the basis of the total household energy consumption. The NN method models the residential energy consumption as a neural network, which is an information-processing model inspired by the way the densely interconnected, parallel structure of the brain processes information.In this paper, the three methods are briefly described and a comparative assessment of the three methods is presented.

Our calculations confirm that including endogenous innovation implies earlier emission reduction to meet atmospheric carbon concentration constraints. However, the effect is stronger than suggested in the literature. Moreover, the development of non-fossil energy technologies constitutes the most important opportunity for emission reductions.

abstract = {In Europe and the US, national energy planning agencies value resource alternatives using outmoded techniques, conceived around the time of the Model-T Ford. These models, long since discarded in manufacturing and other industries, bias in favor of riskier fossil alternatives while understating the true value of photovoltaics (PV) and similar low-risk, passive, capital-intensive technologies. PV and similar renewables offer a unique cost-risk menu along with other valuable attributes that traditional valuation models, conceived long before such attributes became technologically feasible, cannot “see” because they are steeped in the vocabulary and measurement concepts of a different technological era. Properly understood and exploited, the attributes of PV could undoubtedly form the basis for reengineering the electricity production and delivery process to deliver cost reductions in ways that can yet not be imagined. Lenders and investors likewise do not yet fully understand the unique financial properties of PV as differentiated from traditional resource alternatives. Policy makers have a responsibility to broaden the analytic horizons to include new valuation models and concepts that more properly reflect the unique attributes of PV.},

abstract = {Most theories of environmental instrument choice focus exclusively on differential compliance costs. But compliance costs comprise only part of the total costs of environmental protection. Administrative costs – particularly the costs of measuring emissions and monitoring compliance – can differ significantly between environmental instruments. Those administrative cost differentials may offset the compliance cost advantages commonly associated with economic instruments, such as tradeable permits and effluent taxes. Moreover, measurement and monitoring constraints may increase ex ante uncertainty over the differential costs and benefits of alternative regulatory policies. That uncertainty may militate against selecting regulatory instruments that appear superior from the perspective of models focusing exclusively on compliance-cost differentials.},

abstract = {Energy is used in dwellings to provide four services: space heating, hot water, lighting and to power appliances. This paper describes how the usage of energy in a UK home results from a complex interaction between built form, location, energy-using equipment, occupants and the affordability of fuel. Current models with standard occupancy predict that energy use will be strongly related to size and built form, but surveys of real homes show only weak correlations, across all types of dwelling. Recent research has given us insights into occupancy factors including preferred comfort, [`]take-back' from thermal efficiency improvements, and patterns of electricity use. Space heating is on a downward trend and is low in new dwellings. Energy use for lights and appliances, which is only weakly related to built form, is increasing. Strong legislation, combined with low-carbon technologies, will be needed to counteract this trend. Future challenges discussed include increases in real energy prices and climate change mitigation efforts, which are likely to improve the existing stock. Challenging targets are now in place for new housing to move towards low or zero energy and carbon standards. In the longer term, dwellings will demand less energy. Alternatives to gas for space heating will be increasingly common, including ground source heat and local combined heat and power (CHP) from biomass, while electricity could come from a more decarbonised electricity system. However, these improvements must be set alongside a demand for many new homes, demographic trends towards smaller households, and a more holistic approach to overall carbon use including personal transport.},

Some contributing factors considered are: the focus on carbon production rather than consumption in the architecture of Kyoto; the flaws in the analysis presented in the Stern Report (notably on the impacts of climate change on economic growth, on the costs of mitigation, and on discounting); and the political economy of the choice of policy instruments, the politics of the rents that arise, and the technology bias. The challenges facing the Copenhagen conference are noted, and it is concluded that, with a recasting of the economics of climate change, the prospects for closing the gap between the science and policy are grim.},

The emissions growth rate since 2000 was greater than for the most fossil-fuel intensive of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions scenarios developed in the late 1990s. Global emissions growth since 2000 was driven by a cessation or reversal of earlier declining trends in the energy intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) (energy/GDP) and the carbon intensity of energy (emissions/energy), coupled with continuing increases in population and per-capita GDP. Nearly constant or slightly increasing trends in the carbon intensity of energy have been recently observed in both developed and developing regions. No region is decarbonizing its energy supply. The growth rate in emissions is strongest in rapidly developing economies, particularly China. Together, the developing and least-developed economies (forming 80% of the world's population) accounted for 73% of global emissions growth in 2004 but only 41% of global emissions and only 23% of global cumulative emissions since the mid-18th century. The results have implications for global equity.},

abstract = {This paper argues against the common-sense conclusion that climate change demands a global market-based solution, such as international emissions trading. First, current experience suggests global cooperation is not necessary for initial mandatory actions. Second, when domestic targets vary across nations, there are a variety of reasons why international emissions trading, even though it creates aggregate economic gains for all nations, may not be desirable. These reasons include concerns over legitimizing target variations for future negotiations, real and perceived consequences of capital flows across nations, and distributional impacts within nations. Finally, the underlying need for global technology solutions suggests domestic mitigation policies that balance clear emissions price signals, incentives for technology development and deployment, and mechanisms to finance deployment to developing countries. International efforts, in turn, might focus on encouraging these domestic actions, facilitating the developing country investment mechanisms, and providing credible reviews of national action.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for exploring future transformations in the UK housing stock. The method is shown to be more robust and faster than existing methods through various tests. A Java-based implementation of the method in a new model of the UK housing stock, DECarb, is examined using a back-cast scenario from 1970 to 1996. The results show an average difference of -5.4% between predicted and actual energy demand. Comparison with predicted carbon emissions from the BRE's BREHOMES model shows a difference of around -0.9% for the same period. These results suggest that DECarb is likely to be an effective tool in examining future scenarios since the same objects and processes used in back-casting in the model are also used in forecasting. The model has an open framework and could therefore significantly benefit ongoing domestic and non-domestic climate futures research.},

We perform an uncertainty analysis on the future evolution of oil/gas/coal and carbon prices using a global econometric model, E3MG, with an energy technology submodel. We investigate the robustness of various proposed climate and energy policies under different energy/carbon price scenarios. We also discuss the likely economic effects of such uncertainty, focusing particularly on investment in the electricity supply sector. Implications for robust policy design and potential ways to mitigate uncertainty for investors in low carbon electricity generation are discussed. In particular, we consider potential policy designs that are capable of achieving stringent mitigation targets and are also resilient to foreseeable risks.

@article{Buchner2006,
abstract = {Abstract  Despite the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, the US decision not to comply with its Kyoto commitments seems to drastically undermine the effectiveness of the Protocol in controlling GHG emissions. Therefore, it is important to explore whether there are economic incentives that might help the US to modify its current decision and move to a more environmentally effective climate policy. For example, can an increased participation of developing countries induce the US to effectively participate in the effort to reduce GHG emissions? Is a single emission trading market the appropriate policy framework to increase the signatories of the Kyoto Protocol? This paper addresses the above questions by analysing whether the participation of China in the cooperative effort to control GHG emissions can provide adequate incentives for the US to re-join the Kyoto process and eventually ratify the Kyoto Protocol. This paper analyses three different climate regimes in which China could be involved and assesses the economic incentives for the major world countries and regions to participate in these three regimes. The main conclusion is that the participation of the US in a climate regime is not likely, at least in the short run. The US is more likely to adopt unilateral policies than to join the present Kyoto coalition (even when it includes China). However, a two bloc regime would become the most preferred option if both China and the US, for some political or environmental reasons, decide to cooperate on GHG emission control. If the US decides to cooperate, the climate regime that provides the highest economic incentives to the cooperating countries is the one in which China and the US cooperate bilaterally, with the Annex B−US countries remaining within the Kyoto framework.},

abstract = {With the wholesale electric power market opened in April 2005, deregulation of the electric power industry in Japan has faced a new competitive environment. In the new environment, Independent Power Producer (IPP), Power Producer and Supplier (PPS), Load Service Entity (LSE), and electric utility can trade electric energy through both bilateral contracts and single-price auction at the electricity market. In general, the market clearing price (MCP) is largely changed by the amount of total load demand in the market. The influence may cause a price spike, and consequently the volatility of MCP will make LSEs and their customers face a risk of higher revenue and cost. DSM is attractive as a means of load leveling, and has an effect on decreasing MCP at peak load period. Introducing Energy Storage systems (ES) is one DSM in order to change demand profile at the customer side. In the case that customers decrease their own demand due to increased MCP, a bidding strategy of generating companies may be changed. As a result, MCP is changed through such complex mechanism. In this paper the authors evaluate MCP by multi-agent. It is considered that customer-side ES has an effect on MCP fluctuation. Through numerical examples, this paper evaluates the influence on MCP by controlling customer-side ES corresponding to variation of MCP. � 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Equilibrium sensitivity, including slower surface albedo feedbacks, is $\sim$6°C for doubled CO2 for the range of climate states between glacial conditions and ice-free Antarctica. Decreasing CO2 was the main cause of a cooling trend that began 50 million years ago, the planet being nearly ice-free until CO2 fell to 450±100 ppm; barring prompt policy changes, that critical level will be passed, in the opposite direction, within decades. If humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm, but likely less that. The largest uncertainty in the target arises from possible changes of non-CO2 forcings. An initial 350 ppm CO2 target may be achievable by phasing out coal use except where CO2 is captured and adopting agricultural and forestry practices that sequester carbon. If the present overshoot of this target CO2 is not brief, there is a possibility of seeding irreversible catastrophic effects.},

abstract = {The shadow price, or ‘social cost', of carbon is an important indicator of the global incremental damage done by emitting greenhouse gases today. Cost–benefit analysis would set the optimal amount of greenhouse-gas-emission reduction at the point where this social cost just equals the incremental cost of controlling emissions. The higher the value for the social cost of carbon, the more control is warranted. This comparison assumes that cost–benefit analysis is the correct way of determining climate-change policy, and many believe this is not the case because of the very long-term, irreversible, and potentially catastrophic nature of global warming. But, in the short run at least, a comparison of cost and benefits is required, and, in any event, all decisions imply costs and benefits. But what is the ‘right' figure for the social cost of carbon? This paper reviews the UK government's assessment of the cost and concludes that it has been set far too high because of a misreading of the integrated assessment models used to balance costs and benefits. Moreover, adoption of the UK government's shadow price would have formidable implications for energy policy in the UK, and for policies on afforestation.},

While attention has been understandably focussed on the ratification process, it is time to begin thinking about the next steps for the global climate regime, particularly in terms of a deeper inclusion of developing countries' concerns and interests. This paper begins doing so from the perspective of the developing countries. The principal argument is that we need to return to the basic principles outlined in the Framework Convention on Climate Change in searching for a north–south bargain on climate change. Such a bargain may be achievable if we can realign the policy architecture of the climate regime to its original stated goals of sustainable development.},

@article{Barker2009b,
abstract = {Abstract  This paper examines the macroeconomic rebound effect for the global economy arising from energy-efficiency policies. Such
policies are expected to be a leading component of climate policy portfolios being proposed and adopted in order to achieve
climate stabilisation targets for 2020, 2030 and 2050, such as the G8 50% reduction target by 2050. We apply the global “New
Economics” or Post Keynesian model E3MG, developing the version reported in IPCC AR4 WG3. The rebound effect refers to the
idea that some or all of the expected reductions in energy consumption as a result of energy-efficiency improvements are offset
by an increasing demand for energy services, arising from reductions in the effective price of energy services resulting from
those improvements. As policies to stimulate energy-efficiency improvements are a key part of climate-change policies, the
likely magnitude of any rebound effect is of great importance to assessing the effectiveness of those policies. The literature
distinguishes three types of rebound effect from energy-efficiency improvements: direct, indirect and economy-wide. The macroeconomic
rebound effect, which is the focus of this paper, is the combination of the indirect and economy-wide effects. Estimates of
the effects of no-regrets efficiency policies are reported by the International Energy Agency in World Energy Outlook, 2006,
and synthesised in the IPCC AR4 WG3 report. We analyse policies for the transport, residential and services buildings and
industrial sectors of the economy for the post-2012 period, 2013–2030. The estimated direct rebound effect, implicit in the
IEA WEO/IPCC AR4 estimates, is treated as exogenous, based on estimates from the literature, globally about 10%. The total
rebound effect, however, is 31% by 2020 rising to 52% by 2030. The total effect includes the direct effect and the effects
of (1) the lower cost of energy on energy demand in the three broad sectors as well as of (2) the extra consumers' expenditure
from higher (implicit) real income and (3) the extra energy-efficiency investments. The rebound effects build up over time
as the economic system adapts to the higher real incomes from the energy savings and the investments.},

@article{Blyth2007,
abstract = {This paper describes results from a model of decision-making under uncertainty using a real options methodology, developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The model represents investment decisions in power generation from the perspective of a private company. The investments are subject to uncertain future climate policy, which is treated as an external risk factor over which the company has no control. The aims of this paper are to (i) quantify these regulatory risks in order to improve understanding of how policy uncertainty may affect investment behaviour by private companies and (ii) illustrate the effectiveness of the real options approach as a policy analysis tool. The study analysed firms' investment options of coal- and gas-fired power plants and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Policy uncertainty is represented as an exogenous event that creates uncertainty in the carbon price. Our findings indicate that climate policy uncertainty creates a risk premium for power generation investments. In the case of gas- and coal-fired power generation, the risk premium would lead to an increase in electricity prices of 5-10% in order to stimulate investment. In the case of CCS, the risk premium would increase the carbon price required to stimulate investment by 16-37% compared to a situation of perfect certainty. The option to retrofit CCS acts as a hedge against high future carbon prices, and could accelerate investment in coal plant. This paper concludes that to minimise investment risks in low carbon technologies, policy-makers should aim to provide some long-term regulatory certainty.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the world economic implications of climate change policy strategies, and particularly evaluates the impacts of an implementation of clean development mechanisms (CDM), joint implementation (JI) and emissions trading with a world integrated assessment model. Of special interest in this context are welfare spill over and competitiveness effects resulting from diverse climate policy strategies. This study elaborates and compares multi-gas policy strategies and explores the impacts of sink inclusion. We furthermore examine the economic impacts on all world regions of the USA's non-cooperative, free rider position resulting from its recent isolated climate policy strategy decision. It turns out that CDM and JI show evidence of improvement in the economic development in host countries and increase the share of new applied technologies. The decomposition of welfare effects demonstrates that the competitiveness effect (including the spill over effects from trade) have the greatest importance because of the intense trade relations between countries. Climatic effects will have a significant impact within the next 50 years, will cause considerable welfare losses to world regions and will intensify if nations highly responsible for pollution like the USA do not reduce their emissions.},

abstract = {The 2007 Bali conference heard repeated calls for reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions of 50 per cent by 2050 to avoid exceeding the 2 degrees C threshold. While such endpoint targets dominate the policy agenda, they do not, in isolation, have a scientific basis and are likely to lead to dangerously misguided policies. To be scientifically credible, policy must be informed by an understanding of cumulative emissions and associated emission pathways. This analysis considers the implications of the 2 degrees C threshold and a range of post-peak emission reduction rates for global emission pathways and cumulative emission budgets. The paper examines whether empirical estimates of greenhouse gas emissions between 2000 and 2008, a period typically modelled within scenario studies, combined with short-term extrapolations of current emissions trends, significantly constrains the 2000-2100 emission pathways. The paper concludes that it is increasingly unlikely any global agreement will deliver the radical reversal in emission trends required for stabilization at 450 ppmv carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). Similarly, the current framing of climate change cannot be reconciled with the rates of mitigation necessary to stabilize at 550 ppmv CO2e and even an optimistic interpretation suggests stabilization much below 650 ppmv CO2e is improbable.},

abstract = {There has been considerable debate as to whether the revenue-neutral substitution of environmental taxes for ordinary income taxes might offer a double dividend: not only (1) improve the environment but also (2) reduce certain costs of the tax system. This paper articulates different notions of double dividend and examines the theoretical and empirical evidence for each. It also connects the double-dividend issue with principles of optimal environmental taxation in a second-best setting. A weak double-dividend claim-that returning tax revenues through cuts in distortionary taxes leads to cost savings relative to the case where revenues are returned lump sum-is easily defended on theoretical grounds and (thankfully) receives wide support from numerical simulations. The stronger versions contend that revenueneutral swaps of environmental taxes for ordinary distortionary taxes involve zero or negative gross costs. Theoretical analyses and numerical results tend to cast doubt on the strong double-dividend claim, although the theoretical case is not air-tight and the numerical evidence is mixed.},

The greenhouse effect is a baffling problem and one that may even threaten ecological and human disaster. What are the chances of the world's nations agreeing to limit their energy consumption at a time when the Third World is industrializing faster than ever? This article shows why effective limits to greenhouse gas emissions will not be negotiable on the basis of country-by-country targets.

A limited number of realistic options currently exist to reduce carbon emissions from the electricity sector, including efficiency improvements, increased use of renewable energy sources, carbon sequestration plants, and nuclear power. This paper investigates how UK's economic and energy growth projections can be reconciled with the government's plans for carbon abatement, given that renewable energy has practicable limitations and feasible electricity efficiency improvements are constrained below 2%/yr.

abstract = {There is a growing interest in reducing energy consumption and the associated greenhouse gas emissions in every sector of the economy. The residential sector is a substantial consumer of energy in every country, and therefore a focus for energy consumption efforts. Since the energy consumption characteristics of the residential sector are complex and inter-related, comprehensive models are needed to assess the technoeconomic impacts of adopting energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies suitable for residential applications.
The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review of the various modeling techniques used for modeling residential sector energy consumption. Two distinct approaches are identified: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach treats the residential sector as an energy sink and is not concerned with individual end-uses. It utilizes historic aggregate energy values and regresses the energy consumption of the housing stock as a function of top-level variables such as macroeconomic indicators (e.g. gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation), energy price, and general climate. The bottom-up approach extrapolates the estimated energy consumption of a representative set of individual houses to regional and national levels, and consists of two distinct methodologies: the statistical method and the engineering method.
Each technique relies on different levels of input information, different calculation or simulation techniques, and provides results with different applicability. A critical review of each technique, focusing on the strengths, shortcomings and purposes, is provided along with a review of models reported in the literature.},

abstract = {In this paper, which forms a chapter in the forthcoming Book “Delivering a Low Carbon Electricity System: Technologies, Economics and Policy”, Grubb and Newbery examine how carbon for electricity generation should be priced. They begin by suggesting that it is not clear what the correct price of carbon is, but that it spans the whole range of economically plausible prices. They then go on to discuss the theoretical merits of taxes versus quotas, concluding that theoretically a stable tax would best reflect the true social cost of emissions, which should not change with market conditions. They then go to evaluate the EU Emissions Trading Scheme where allowances for the emission of CO2 are traded (EUAs). The price signals offered by the scheme in its first trading period have been very unsatisfactory with high variability and the price trending down towards very low levels as it has become clear that governments were much too generous in their initial allocation of quotas. What is needed is a stable investment environment for low carbon generation investments. They discuss a number of policy options to achieve this: long period commitments on quotas; allowing unconstrained banking and borrowing of EUAs over multiple periods; long term price declarations to be used in allocation auctions; government issued contracts for differences on the future carbon price; or simply to issue low-carbon electricity contracts. The authors conclude with a discussion of the scope for international agreements on carbon emissions reduction. They conclude that imperfect though it is the EU ETS is a good place to start to link up emerging trading regimes, and that quota systems have more of a chance of commanding international agreement at least initially. However any international climate change agreement will be difficult to establish.},

@article{Keith2005,
abstract = {It is physically possible to capture CO2 directly from the air and immobilize it in geological structures. Air capture differs from conventional mitigation in three key aspects. First, it removes emissions from any part of the economy with equal ease or difficulty, so its cost provides an absolute cap on the cost of mitigation. Second, it permits reduction in concentrations faster than the natural carbon cycle: the effects of irreversibility are thus partly alleviated. Third, because it is weakly coupled to existing energy infrastructure, air capture may offer stronger economies of scale and smaller adjustment costs than the more conventional mitigation technologies. We assess the ultimate physical limits on the amount of energy and land required for air capture and describe two systems that might achieve air capture at prices under 200 and 500 $/tC using current technology. Like geoengineering, air capture limits the cost of a worst-case climate scenario. In an optimal sequential decision framework with uncertainty, existence of air capture decreases the need for near-term precautionary abatement. The long-term effect is the opposite; assuming that marginal costs of mitigation decrease with time while marginal climate change damages increase, then air capture increases long-run abatement. Air capture produces an environmental Kuznets curve, in which concentrations are returned to preindustrial levels.},

abstract = {Liberalisation of energy markets has been progressing among OECD countries since the early nineties. In Europe this trend was accelerated by the decision in December 1996 by the EU Council of Ministers to adopt a new EU directive on liberalisation of the electricity market. This decision was based on the assumption that a liberalised market with commercial competition would lead to higher efficiency and lower consumer prices. Most EU governments have accepted the new EU directive based on these commercial arguments. Denmark has, however, been in a different situation because its energy policy is based primarily on environmental considerations. Danish energy policy involves government promotion of energy conservation and of systems based on renewable energy sources. This type of policy may in some instances conflict with the principles of the unregulated commercial market. The official Danish target is that 35% of energy demand should be covered by renewables by year 2030. The present paper analyzes the problems and possibilities of meeting this target taking into account the rules of the new EU directive on liberalisation.},

abstract = {The Antarctic Vostok ice core provided compelling evidence of the nature of climate, and of climate feedbacks, over the past 420,000 years. Marine records suggest that the amplitude of climate variability was smaller before that time, but such records are often poorly resolved. Moreover, it is not possible to infer the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from marine records. Here we report the recovery of a deep ice core from Dome C, Antarctica, that provides a climate record for the past 740,000 years. For the four most recent glacial cycles, the data agree well with the record from Vostok. The earlier period, between 740,000 and 430,000 years ago, was characterized by less pronounced warmth in interglacial periods in Antarctica, but a higher proportion of each cycle was spent in the warm mode. The transition from glacial to interglacial conditions about 430,000 years ago (Termination V) resembles the transition into the present interglacial period in terms of the magnitude of change in temperatures and greenhouse gases, but there are significant differences in the patterns of change. The interglacial stage following Termination V was exceptionally long--28,000 years compared to, for example, the 12,000 years recorded so far in the present interglacial period. Given the similarities between this earlier warm period and today, our results may imply that without human intervention, a climate similar to the present one would extend well into the future.},

@article{Gritsevskyi2000,
abstract = {This paper presents a new method for modeling-induced technological learning and uncertainty in energy systems. Three related features are introduced simultaneously: (1) increasing returns to scale for the costs of new technologies; (2) clusters of linked technologies that induce learning depending on their technological "proximity" in addition to the technology relations through the structure (and connections) of the energy system; and (3) uncertain costs of all technologies and energy sources. The energy systems-engineering model MESSAGE developed at IIASA was modified to include these three new features. MESSAGE is a linear programming optimization model. The starting point for this new approach was a global (single-region) energy systems version of the MESSAGE model that includes more than 100 different energy extraction, conversion, transport, distribution and end-use technologies. A new feature is that the future costs of all technologies are uncertain and assumed to be distributed according to the log-normal distribution. These are stylized distribution functions that indirectly reflect the cost distributions of energy technologies in the future based on the analysis of the IIASA energy technology inventory. In addition, the expected value of these cost distributions is assumed to decrease and variance to narrow with the increasing application of new technologies. This means that the process of technological learning is uncertain even as cumulative experience increases. New technologies include, for example, fuel cells, photovoltaic and wind energy conversion technologies. The technologies are related through the structure of energy system in MESSAGE. For example, cheaper wind energy has direct and indirect effects on other technologies that produce electricity up-stream and on electric end-use technologies downstream. In addition, technologies are grouped into clusters that depend on technological "proximity." For example, the costs of all fuel cells for mobile applications are a function of their combined installed capacity weighted according to their expected unit sizes. This relationship depends on how closely the technologies are related. This varying degree of "collective" technological learning for technologies belonging to the same cluster is also uncertain. Each scenario of alternative future developments for a deterministic version of the global energy systems model MESSAGE requires approximately 10 min of CPU time on PC with Intel Pentium II 233 MHz and 128 MB of RAM. Therefore, it is simply infeasible to generate alternative future developments under uncertainty based on a simple Monte-Carlo type of analysis were one sequentially draws observations from the very large number of more than 200,000 cost distributions (100 technologies, 11 time steps, 10 technological clusters with 22 technologies included) assumed here for modeling technological learning and uncertainty. Instead, the new approach proposed here starts with a large but finite number of alternative energy systems "technology dynamics" and generates in "parallel" another large but finite number of deterministic scenarios by sampling from the distributions simultaneously for each of these technology dynamics. In this application, about 130,000 scenarios were generated. There were 520 alternative technology dynamics each with about 250 alternative deterministic scenarios resulting from the simultaneous stochastic samplings. Both numbers were initially varied before deciding that about 500 is a sufficient number of different technology dynamics required for a wide spectrum of alternative technological learning possibilities and that about 250 different deterministic scenarios is a sufficient number to generate most of the interesting future energy systems structures for each of the technology dynamics based on the analysis that in total produced roughly one million different scenarios. These large numbers of scenarios represent a very small subset of all possible ones that is basically infinite. They were not chosen randomly, but are a result of applying adaptive global search technique to the formulated non-convex, non-smooth stochastic problem. From the 520 alternative technology dynamics, about 53 resulted in scenarios with very similar overall energy systems cost. They have fundamentally different technological dynamics and produce a wide range of different emergent energy systems but can be considered to be approximately equivalent with respect to "optimality" criteria (in this case simultaneous cost and risk minimization). Thus, one of the results of the analysis is that different structures of energy system emerge with similar overall costs, i.e., that there is a large diversity across alternative energy technology strategies. The strategies are path dependent and it is not possible to choose a priori "optimal" direction of energy systems development. Another result of the analysis is that the endogenous technology learning with uncertainty and spillover effects have the greatest impact on the emerging structures of energy system during the first few decades of the next century. Over these "intermediate" periods of time these two processes create effective lock-in effects and increasing returns to adoption. In the very long run, however, all of these effects are not of a great importance. The reason is that over such long periods many doubling of capacity of all technologies with inherent leaning occur so that there are few relative cost advantages that result from large investments in some technologies and clusters. Therefore, the main finding is that under uncertainty the near-term investment decisions in new technologies are more important in determining the direction of long-term development of the energy system than are the decisions that are made later, towards the end of the time horizon. Thus, the most dynamic phase in the development of future energy systems occurs during the next few decades. It is during this period that there is a high freedom of choice across future technologies and many of these choices lead to high spillover learning effects for related technologies. One policy implication that can be made based on the emerging dynamics and different directions of energy systems development in this analysis is that future RD&D efforts and investments in new technologies should be distributed across "related" technologies rather than be directed at only one technology from the cluster even if it appears as a "winner." Another implication is that it is better not to spread RD&D efforts and technology investments across a large portfolio of future technologies. It is rather better to focus on (related) technologies that might form technology clusters.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes the development of a new hybrid MARKAL-Macro (M-M) energy system model for the UK. This hybrid model maintains the technological and sectoral detail of a bottom-up optimisation approach with aggregated energy demand endogeneity and GDP impacts from a single sector neoclassical growth model. The UK M-M model was developed for underpinning analysis of the UK's groundbreaking mandatory long-term - 60% carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction target. Hybrid modelling illustrates that long-term UK CO2 emission reductions are feasible. However, there are endemic uncertainties, notably a trade-off between behavioural and technological decarbonisation options with resultant energy system impacts in the requirements for zero-carbon electricity. UK M-M model sensitivity runs further illustrate the range of energy system interactions including the deployment of the UK's limited CO2 storage capacity, alternate timing of power vs. transport sectoral reductions, the relative ease of switching between electricity generation portfolios, and substitution opportunities between natural gas and coal. The macro-economic cost impacts range from 0.3% to 1.5% reduction in UK GDP by 2050, with higher cost estimates strongly influenced by pessimistic assessments of future low-carbon technologies. However cost impacts from the UK M-M model are likely to be in the lower range for stringent CO2 reduction pathways as the simplicity of the reduced form macro-linkage omits competitiveness and transitional impacts on the UK economy.},

This paper presents results of research that examines past experience in controlling other major power plant emissions that might serve as a reasonable guide to future rates of technological progress in CCS systems. In particular, we focus on US and worldwide experience with sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) control technologies over the past 30 years, and derive empirical learning rates for these technologies. Applying these rates to CCS costs in a large-scale IA model shows that the cost of achieving a climate stabilization target are significantly lower relative to scenarios with no learning for CCS technologies.},

Therefore, research on climate policy is focussing on the forthcoming negotiations on the policy architecture and abatement commitments that will be adopted after 2012. This paper adopts a game-theoretic approach to model climate policy and provides some results on the implications of alternative emission reduction targets beyond 2012. In particular, six scenarios are discussed and their impacts on the main economic variables are assessed. Most importantly, the paper will focus on the relationship between future emission targets and participation incentives, namely, it will examine whether there exist future emission targets that could be accepted by the US, China and other major emitters of greenhouse gases. Some suggestions for the design of future negotiation targets will also be put forward.},

abstract = {There has been considerable debate as to whether the revenue-neutral substitution of environmental taxes for ordinary income taxes might offer a double dividend: not only (1) improve the environment but also (2) reduce certain costs of the tax system. This paper articulates different notions of double dividend and examines the theoretical and empirical evidence for each. It also connects the double-dividend issue with principles of optimal environmental taxation in a second-best setting. A weak double-dividend claim-that returning tax revenues through cuts in distortionary taxes leads to cost savings relative to the case where revenues are returned lump sum-is easily defended on theoretical grounds and (thankfully) receives wide support from numerical simulations. The stronger versions contend that revenueneutral swaps of environmental taxes for ordinary distortionary taxes involve zero or negative gross costs. Theoretical analyses and numerical results tend to cast doubt on the strong double-dividend claim, although the theoretical case is not air-tight and the numerical evidence is mixed.},

@article{Trenberth1988,
abstract = {Variations in the hydrological cycle and the water vapor content of the atmosphere form a vital part of the ‘‘greenhouse'' feedback mechanism that can substantially enhance perturbations in the atmosphere arising from changes in forcing, such as those associated with increases in the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. An analysis is therefore made of the mean annual cycle, interannual variability and trends in global-scale water vapor content of the atmosphere for December 1978 through December 1985, using global analyses from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts. Since the variations in total atmospheric mass are almost entirely dure to water vapor, two entirely independent global measures of the water vapor content can be compared. These are the total surface pressure due to water vapor from humidity analyses and the total surface pressure itself. For the mean annual cycle these show excellent agreement, and the analyses are therefore compatible with the constraint that the total mass of dry air is conserved. However, it appears that both the interannual variability and trends in water vapor are sufficiently small that they are lost in the noise level of the data. A new estimate of the total mass of the atmosphere is 5.1361×1018 kg for the annual mean, corresponding to a mean surface pressure of 984.43 mbar. It ranges from 5.1352×1018 kg in January to 5.1371×1018 kg in July, owing to the annual cycle in global water vapor which has an amplitude of 1.0×1015 kg (0.2 mbar). The total mass of dry air is estimated to be 5.123×1018 kg (or 981.9 mbar). Also presented is the partitioning of the mass for both the total and the water vapor into the contributions from each hemisphere and as a function of latitude.},

abstract = {This study reviews different approaches to the political and economic control of global public goods such as global warming. It compares quantity-oriented control mechanisms like the Kyoto Protocol with price-type control mechanisms such as internationally harmonized carbon taxes. The analysis focuses on such issues as the relationship to ultimate targets, performance under conditions of uncertainty, volatility of induced carbon prices, the inefficiencies of taxation and regulation, potential for corruption and accounting finagling, and ease of implementation. It concludes that price-type approaches such as carbon taxes have major advantages for slowing global warming.},

Warming is larger in the Western Equatorial Pacific than in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific over the past century, and we suggest that the increased West–East temperature gradient may have increased the likelihood of strong El Ni{\~{n}}os, such as those of 1983 and 1998. Comparison of measured sea surface temperatures in the Western Pacific with paleoclimate data suggests that this critical ocean region, and probably the planet as a whole, is approximately as warm now as at the Holocene maximum and within ≈1°C of the maximum temperature of the past million years. We conclude that global warming of more than ≈1°C, relative to 2000, will constitute “dangerous” climate change as judged from likely effects on sea level and extermination of species.},

abstract = {The problem of massive emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the burning of fossil fuels and their climatic impact have become major scientific and political issues. Future stabilization of the atmospheric CO2 content requires a drastic decrease of CO2 emissions worldwide. Energy savings and carbon sequestration, including CO2 capture/storage and enhancement of natural carbon sinks, can be highly beneficial, although it is suggested that both economic and climatic feedbacks could nullify part of the gains achieved. Fossil fuels (coupled with CO2 capture), and lower-carbon hydrogenated fuels such as natural gas are still expected to play an important role in the future. Nevertheless, stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentration in a growing world economy, now dependent on fossil fuels for 85% of its energy, will also require a vast increase in the supply of carbon-free power. Among these energy sources, hydropower and nuclear energy (operated under western safety and environmental standards) are the most readily available sources capable of supplying vast amount of energy at a competitive price. Wind power is also to be encouraged, as it is expected to approach the competitiveness threshold soon. The French example, where fossil fuel CO2 emissions were cut by 27% in a matter of a few years (1979-1986) despite increasing energy consumption, suggests that implementing CO2 stabilization is technically feasible at a competitive price.},

abstract = {Abstract The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has calculated and shown that, currently, the buildings sector has the largest potential for low-cost carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation in the short to medium term from application of technological options among the sectors examined, based on bottom–up studies. The potential estimates, however, were derived with no regard to indirect costs of CO2 mitigation, associated benefits, and non-technological options; these factors might change the magnitude of the potential and the costs associated with its implementation. The question emerges how accurate the indicators of the economic potential are according to the current IPCC method and how much they might change if all factors mentioned were taken into account. While research results are presently not sufficient to fully answer this question and quantitative analyses of non-technological options, transaction costs associated with barriers, and non-energy benefits are scarce and fragmented, this paper makes a first attempt to assess the presently available literature in the field. The paper concludes that the ballpark is right for the figures reporting the cost-effective potentials in the buildings sector; however, these assessments indeed need to be corrected by incurred transaction costs and co-benefits relevant for the particular assessment, as well as the potential of non-technological options. The paper also outlines a research agenda in the area so that a possible next Assessment Report of the IPCC can derive a more accurate estimate of the bottom–up potential of CO2 mitigation.},

However, there are also problematic areas where they intersect. A core issue--and as yet an unresolved one--is whether and how emission credit trading and other activities envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol would be subject to WTO rules. The resolution of this issue will affect many other issues as well.

abstract = {The "safety valve" is a possible addition to a cap-and-trade system of emissions regulation whereby the authority offers to sell permits in unlimited amount at a pre-set price. In this way the cost of meeting the cap can be limited. It was proposed in the US as a way to control perceived high costs of the Kyoto Protocol, and possibly as a way to shift the focus of policy from the quantity targets of the Protocol to emissions price. In international discussions, the idea emerged as a proposal for a compliance penalty. The usefulness of the safety valve depends on the conditions under which it might be introduced. For a time it might tame an overly stringent emissions target. It also can help control the price volatility during the introduction of gradually tightening one, although permit banking can ultimately serve the same function. It is unlikely to serve as a long-term feature of a cap-and-trade system, however, because of the complexity of coordinating price and quantity instruments and because it will interfere with the development of systems of international emissions trade.},

abstract = {Solar electricity produced by photovoltaic solar cells is one of the most promising options yet identified for sustainably providing the world's future energy requirements. Although the technology has, in the past, been based on the same silicon wafers as used in microelectronics, a transition is in progress to a second generation of a potentially much lower-cost thin-film technology. Cost reductions from both increased manufacturing volume and such improved technology are expected to continue to drive down cell prices over the coming two decades to a level where the cells can provide competitively priced electricity on a large scale. The subsidised, urban residential rooftop application of photovoltaics is expected to provide the major application of the coming decade and to provide the market growth needed to reduce prices. Large centralised solar photovoltaic power stations able to provide low-cost electricity on a large scale would become increasingly attractive approaching 2020.},

However, in the practice of environmental policies, only six countries have implemented taxes based on the carbon content of the energy products.

The evidence shows that carbon taxes may be an interesting policy option and that their main negative impacts may be compensated through the design of the tax and the use of the generated fiscal revenues.},

abstract = {The current cost disadvantage of photovoltaics (PV) risks to reduce its relevance in climate policy strategies. Depending on the used assumptions, electricity from PV can become competitive between 2015 and 2040. Cost competitiveness is, however, a conditional criterion and as an alternative to the learning curve perspective, the future role of PV in electricity production is assessed from a portfolio theory or Capital Asset Pricing Model perspective. In this analysis, the focus is on the input price risks. Fossil fuel price volatility can strongly reduce the financial return of conventional generating technologies. From a welfare perspective, energy planners should try to minimise this risk by adding risk-neutral or no-risk technologies to their portfolio. With an analysis for the year 2025, we illustrate how the addition of renewable capacity to an existing portfolio can lower total portfolio risk without a significant reduction of profitability. PV then emerges as an attractive technology, especially once the best locations for wind energy are already developed.},

A stochastic model for demand growth drives future uncertainty, and investors respond by adding new capacity based on price feedback. The effects on price dynamics of delays in the supply response, through information lag or construction time, are illustrated through simulations. The model is extended to account for the physical reliability problem resulting from a lack of generation capacity. It is shown how inappropriate intervention by regulators, through the use of price caps, can result in a critical decrease in the markets' reserve margin.},

abstract = {In this paper, which forms a chapter in the forthcoming Book “Delivering a Low Carbon Electricity System: Technologies, Economics and Policy”, Grubb and Newbery examine how carbon for electricity generation should be priced. They begin by suggesting that it is not clear what the correct price of carbon is, but that it spans the whole range of economically plausible prices. They then go on to discuss the theoretical merits of taxes versus quotas, concluding that theoretically a stable tax would best reflect the true social cost of emissions, which should not change with market conditions. They then go to evaluate the EU Emissions Trading Scheme where allowances for the emission of CO2 are traded (EUAs). The price signals offered by the scheme in its first trading period have been very unsatisfactory with high variability and the price trending down towards very low levels as it has become clear that governments were much too generous in their initial allocation of quotas. What is needed is a stable investment environment for low carbon generation investments. They discuss a number of policy options to achieve this: long period commitments on quotas; allowing unconstrained banking and borrowing of EUAs over multiple periods; long term price declarations to be used in allocation auctions; government issued contracts for differences on the future carbon price; or simply to issue low-carbon electricity contracts. The authors conclude with a discussion of the scope for international agreements on carbon emissions reduction. They conclude that imperfect though it is the EU ETS is a good place to start to link up emerging trading regimes, and that quota systems have more of a chance of commanding international agreement at least initially. However any international climate change agreement will be difficult to establish.},

Environmental taxes have been widely introduced across Europe and 
elsewhere over the last 20 years. Many organisations have advocated a 
more widespread or radical adoption of green taxes. But what evidence is 
there that green taxes are actually effective? Indeed, what do we mean by 
effectiveness, how can it be assessed, and what are the factors that affect 
it?  
This briefing looks at these issues and draws conclusions from the review of 
evidence that the Green Fiscal Commission has conducted on the practical 
effectiveness of green taxes, particularly in relation to their reduction of 
environmental impacts. We conclude that, where environmental taxes have 
been evaluated, the evidence is overwhelming that they are an effective 
means of reducing environmental impacts. Some green taxes will also 
generate tax revenues for government which are stable over time. This 
briefing also highlights some important factors that contribute to the 
effectiveness of green taxes.},

It sets out the arguments, mostly based on the market failures of environmental externalities and inadequate private investment in R&D, for giving greater public support for nuclear power, using the UK as a case-study. The conclusions are: (i) Government implicitly regards nuclear power as suffering from non-climate change externalities that balance its climate change advantages, and thus does not give nuclear the same advantages as renewables; (ii) there is a case for limited public R&D support for long-term, radical nuclear technology; (iii) nuclear power will only become a serious choice for new private investment if it can become an `ordinary' technology, and the conditions for ordinariness are set out.},

A new electricity pricing theory is described that incorporates future uncertainty and intertemporal linkages between decisions. It indicates that electricity prices should contain two terms -- short-run marginal cost plus a term that reflects how each particular decision is likely to affect future global welfare. We explore a practical implementation using spot prices and forward contracts plus financial instruments for risk sharing and decision coordination, and a procedure for developing long-term pricing policy. The operation of industrial plant has been investigated and models developed to optimize plant behaviour in response to spot prices and forward contracts for electricity. These models are described and results of simulation studies discussed. The studies illustrate the economic efficiency and risk sharing advantages of this advanced tariff structure compared with a conventional time-of-use tariff.},

South; (2) simple rules for allocating emission reductions across countries (such as uniform reductions) may
well be efficient even if international trade in emission permits is not allowed; and (3) when international
emission permit trade does occur it may make both participants in the trade worse off and increase global

abstract = {This article assesses emissions scenarios in the literature, originally documented in the scenario database that was developed more than 7 years ago. The original scenario assessment and literature review has been used, among other things, as the basis for the quantification of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) reference scenarios and the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) stabilization scenarios. In the meantime, a large number of new emissions scenarios have been developed and published. We have collected the relevant information about these new scenarios with the objective to assess the more recent perspectives about future global emissions and to assess the changes in the perspectives about future emissions and their driving forces that may have occurred since the publication of SRES and TAR scenarios. Our analysis goes beyond mere comparisons of emissions ranges. In particular, we explore the underlying drivers of emissions using the so-called IPAT identity (Impacts are proportional to the product of Population, Affluence, and Technology). When IPAT analysis refers to carbon emissions it is called the Kaya identity, where carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are assumed to correspond to the product of population, per capita income, energy intensity of gross domestic product (GDP), and CO2 intensity of energy. Comparing the recent scenario literature with the scenarios developed before TAR shows that there are strong similarities for the main underlying tendencies in many of the scenario's driving forces and results.
