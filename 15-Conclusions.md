# PART 14: CONCLUSIONS

# 14.1 Framework for Reform

 With this book we have tried to outline the purposes and principles behind the UK tax and welfare system as it stands today, and we have attempted to address where exactly it has been going wrong. Over complexity, poorly communicated purposes, administrative hiccups and lack of public buy-in are all issues with the current structure. 

 Throughout this book, we have shown how the flaws in this system have played out into reality. Principles do not remain abstract. Growing inequality, insufficient retraining and work-friendly support for the unemployed, tax evasion and avoidance. We need to apply a simplified and principled approach in how we fix these mechanisms. By taxing revenue sources in a simplified way, and by taxing unearned wealth so as to lessen the distortive impacts of the tax system, we can help fight inequality and build a better future. Through removing means-testing from welfare provision, and supplying better support in helping people back to work, we can ensure rewarding employment for all. 

These are not pipe dreams. By making our voices heard at the highest levels, and bringing these ideas into popular opinion, we hope to help shift the dialogue away from the hyper-capitalistic rhetoric that is heard loudest by decision makers these days. We want to make a society that is more equitable, fairer, and less unstable than the one we have today. We know our operating system; we know what we want to achieve; and we have the toolkit at our disposal. It's just up to us to learn how to use it properly.

The tax and welfare systems are both powerful tools by which to effect social change. Use them properly, and we could see a society where housing became affordable through use of a land value tax, those who pollute paying for damage they cause, and where people were supported into gainful, decent employment by a state that wants to encourage people to succeed.

 Above all, we emphasise the importance of the idea that any reforms should follow the three principles we outlined at the beginning of the chapter. This is, namely, that any changes should be practical, beneficial and fair. Ensuring that this happens is something that we consider to be a matter of morality. It is also, in a sense, an essential component of success. Through linking the achievement of these to the idea of political acceptance, it becomes clearer to see that these principles are indicative of each other. For the transition to be practical, a concept we can interpret as politically feasible, it needs to be fair, and to be fair it needs to be overarchingly beneficial. 

 Maintaining the principles of fairness in both the transitional phase and the outcome would allow us to really make substantial changes in the way the system operates. A just process, with just effects, is the goal.  We build on the Rawlsian ideas of improving the welfare of the worst off, without sacrificing that of the middle or the top. Change is possible with minimal harm, so long as we combine clever policy design with clear communication about its purpose. 

 Understanding tax as an essential component of living in society, as a useful tool for nudging social behaviours and protecting public goods, and for raising revenue to protect those who most need it in society is the first step towards change. We hope that this book has helped to communicate this message; the first pebble thrown in what could be a landslide.
