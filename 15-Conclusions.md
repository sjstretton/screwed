# PART 14: CONCLUSIONS

# 14.1 Overview

In this book, we have compared the Tax and Welfare system to an operating system - a mechanism of levers through which society is run, funds are raised, and public services are delivered. Using this metaphor, we have been able to troubleshoot the bugs in the current system and illustrate why the UK has seen increasing inequality of outcomes between the best- and the worst-off in our society. 

We have an unwieldy, overly complex tax and welfare system in which the rich get richer, while those on the bottom and in the middle income classes see their income and wealth stagnate. By delivering benefits on a means-tested basis, our benefit system doesn't encourage re-entering employment.

Early on in this book, we outlined the framework with which we would structure our evaluation of the UK tax system, by building on Beveridge's work in fighting his five great evils of society. These guiding principles structure our analysis. We argue for a tax system that is fair and leads to greater equality of opportunity amongst its members. It should be beneficial and contribute to the sustainable and ethical development of society. Finally, such a system should be practical in its administration and application. 

Taxes, amongst their other roles of nudging incentives and redistributing income, are predominately aimed at financing public provision of goods and services - including welfare for the most needy in society. Therefore, we emphasise that these three balls need to be balanced carefully so as to ensure that the UK's Tax and Welfare system helps us build the society that we aim to achieve.

We summarise the findings from our discussion below. Broadly, on the whole, we propose to simplify the income tax and benefit system, and augment taxes where there is a social outcome that needs to be achieved through discouraging negative behaviour. A comprehensive Land Value Tax (LVT) would be phased in, so as to ensure that land was successfully developed, such that any excess rent could be captured and the windfall redistributed.

Our proposals should be considered interim, since we have not yet completed accurate modelling of all their effects.



# 14.2 A SUMMARY OF  RECOMMENDATIONS

We propose a simple tax system which aims to fulfils our requirements of being beneficial, fair and practical. These proposed policies, and the related transitional arrangements, aim to resolve issues around incentives and redistribution in the current UK tax system in a politically achievable way. 

## Main Taxes

1. Replace Business Rates and Council tax with a norm-based LVT consisting of a 100% LVT on increases in land rent. Transition the residual tax to a tax on land wealth.
2. Replace Corporation tax with a 'Dyson' Tax (Cashflow Tax) with half deductability for imports from VAT compliant non-tax havens.  
3. Introduce a corporate wealth tax on the same principles as the Dyson tax.
4. Introduce a layered upstream consumption based Carbon Incentive. Transition this over time to an upstream Consumption based Carbon Tax plus Citizen's Dividend.
5. Simplify Income Tax and NI with a simple progressive income tax system with a very simple rate structure. (The exact details of the rate structure and basic income depend on accurate modelling of the tax system)

## Benefits

1. Replace unemployment benefit with a payment by results conditional work-training hybrid
2. Slowly introduce a citizen's dividend as a compensating payment for additional consumption taxes.
3. Pay for housing benefit automatically out of LVT.
4. Retain other benefits, but fold all means testing into the income tax system, with maximum means testing amount equal to the tax paid on the personal allowance
5. Once this is acheived it is easy, if required, to abolish all personal allowances and replace the whole system with a basic income with additional payments conditional on disability/carer/age status. Note that to avoid the basic income (declining in nominakl real terms) someone would need to pay tax or to do some other activity of value in order to achieve contribution records.

## Further minor taxes

1. Introduce congestion charges in lieu of a carbon tax on transport fuels.
2. Introduce comprehensive environmental and health taxation (packaging tax, sugar, meat tax, and others if needed).
3. Increase the bank balance sheet tax and adapt it counter-cyclically and alter it to favour lending to real businesses.
4. Introduce a comprehensive wealth register. This may take the form of a disclosure requirement on all UK wealth owned by foreigners and on ownership of foreign wealth by uk residents. Combine with a small 0.1% wealth tax on both of these classes of wealth.

# 14.3 Transitional Questions

To ensure that these new proposals are implemented successfully, any transition to the new taxation system would need to to account for the following three effects. 

1) First the transition must be *practical* and *simple* to understand.
2) Second the transition should be, and be seen to be, *fair*.
3) Third the transition should be seen to be *beneficial* in the short term as well as the long term.

Asset value effects are important in this. These are important both from the fairness persective and from the perspective of economic benefit. Volatile rises and falls in asset values are arguably unfair -rises because the people who receive these rises are not necessarily deserving of it; and likewise for any falls. Both of these impacts can be amplificed through ineffective application of government policy. For example, two major government policies -not revaluing Council tax and reductions in long term interest rates - have caused national house price increases.

The following table shows both the final strategic objective and the intermediate/transitional one. 

| **Policy Area**                    | **Initial, Intermediate   Approach**                         | **Final Objective**                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Income Tax                         | Simplify rates structure, make existing benefits universal and add in means testing using tax system instead of benefits means testing. | Income tax is only paid by the upper half of individuals     |
| VAT                                | Remove Exemptions, SImplify                                  | Transition to a profits tax based on UK sales                |
| Carbon Tax                         | A system that gives general incentives based on a high implicit   carbon price that does not raise significant revenue | A high carbon tax used for general revenue                   |
| Money Balance Tax                  | No change from existing system                               | Electronic deposits are taxed at approximately 5% per annum with a significant tax free personal allowance. Cash are registered and are time   limited and a small fees are paid on withdraw |
| Citizen's Dividend                 | Use existing benefit rates that simplify the system and reduce   conditionality. | In the long term, build up a personal sovereign wealth fund to pay   individuals are larger citizen's dividend |
| Guaranteed Training and Employment | Short term, high quality master craftsman level courses for specific   groups to optimize the system | Long term, rolling out the guaranteed training to all sections of the   population |
|                                    |                                                              |                                                              |

 

# 14.4 CONCLUDING REMARKS

With this book we have tried to outline the purposes and principles behind the UK tax and welfare system as it stands today, and we have attempted to address where exactly it has been going wrong. Over complexity, poorly communicated purposes, administrative hiccups and lack of public buy-in are all issues with the current structure. 

Throughout this book, we have shown how the flaws in this system have played out into reality. Principles do not remain abstract. Growing inequality, insufficient retraining and work-friendly support for the unemployed, tax evasion and avoidance. We need to apply a simplified and principled approach in how we fix these mechanisms. By taxing revenue sources in a simplified way, and by taxing unearned wealth so as to lessen the distortive impacts of the tax system, we can help fight inequality and build a better future. Through removing means-testing from welfare provision, and supplying better support in helping people back to work, we can ensure rewarding employment for all. 

These are not pipe dreams. By making our voices heard at the highest levels, and bringing these ideas into popular opinion, we hope to help shift the dialogue away from the hyper-capitalistic rhetoric that is heard loudest by decision makers these days. We want to make a society that is more equitable, fairer, and less unstable than the one we have today. We know our operating system; we know what we want to achieve; and we have the toolkit at our disposal. It's just up to us to learn how to use it properly.

The tax and welfare systems are both powerful tools by which to effect social change. Use them properly, and we could see a society where housing became affordable through use of a land value tax, those who pollute paying for damage they cause, and where people were supported into gainful, decent employment by a state that wants to encourage people to succeed.

Above all, we emphasise the importance of the idea that any reforms should follow the three principles we utlined at the beginning of the chapter. This is, namely, that any changes should be practical, beneficial and fair. Ensuring that this happens is something that we consider to be a matter of morality. It is also, in a sense, an essential component of success. Through linking the achievement of these to the idea of political acceptance, it becomes clearer to see that these principles are indicative of each other. For the transition to be practical, a concept we can interpret as politically feasible, it needs to be fair, and to be fair it needs to be overarchingly beneficial. 

Maintaining the principles of fairness in both the transitional phase and the outcome would allow us to really make substantial changes in the way the system operates. A just process, with just effects, is the goal.  We build on the Rawlsian ideas of improving the welfare of the worst off, without sacrificing that of the middle or the top. Change is possible with minimal harm, so long as we combine clever policy design with clear communication about its purpose. 

Understanding tax as an essential component of living in society, as a useful tool for incentivising companies to do the right thing, and protecting public goods, and for raising revenue to protect those who most need it in society is the first step towards change. We hope that this book has helped to communicate this message; the first pebble thrown in what could be a landslide.
