# 14 Simple Policy Proposals

This section proposes a simple tax system which aims to fulfils our requirements of being beneficial, fair and practical. These proposed policies, and the related transitional arrangements, aim to resolve issues around incentives and redistribution in the current UK tax system in a politically achievable way. 

## Main Taxes

1. Replace Business Rates and Council tax with a norm-based LVT consisting of a 100% LVT on increases in land rent. Transition the residual tax to a tax on land wealth.
2. Replace Corporation tax with a 'Dyson' Tax (Cashflow Tax) with half deductability for imports from VAT compliant non-tax havens.  
3. Introduce a corporate wealth tax on the same principles as the Dyson tax.
4. Introduce a layered upstream consumption based Carbon Incentive. Transition this over time to an upstream Consumption based Carbon Tax plus Citizen's Dividend.
5. Simplify Income Tax and NI with a simple progressive income tax system with a very simple rate structure. (The exact details of the rate structure and basic income depend on accurate modelling of the tax system)

## Benefits

1. Replace unemployment benefit with a payment by results conditional work-training hybrid
2. Slowly introduce a citizen's dividend as a compensating payment for additional consumption taxes.
3. Pay for housing benefit automatically out of LVT.
4. Retain other benefits, but fold all means testing into the income tax system, with maximum means testing amount equal to the tax paid on the personal allowance
5. Once this is acheived it is easy, if required, to abolish all personal allowances and replace the whole system with a basic income with additional payments conditional on disability/carer/age status.

## Further minor taxes

1. Introduce congestion charges in lieu of a carbon tax on transport fuels.
2. Introduce comprehensive environmental and health taxation (packaging tax, sugar, meat tax, and others if needed).
3. Increase the bank balance sheet tax and adapt it counter-cyclically and alter it to favour lending to real businesses.
4. Introduce a comprehensive wealth register. This may take the form of a disclosure requirement on all UK wealth owned by foreigners and on ownership of foreign wealth by uk residents. Combine with a small 0.1% wealth tax on both of these classes of wealth.
