`r tufte::newthought('The earth is facing')` a great number of environmental problems; many of which are caused or contributed to by human economic activity. Everything - from the lakes we drink from, the air we breathe, and the food we eat - is being impacted by irresponsible human action.

This economic activity often causes damage which is not accounted for by the polluting parties themselves, but rather borne by those who have done little to cause them. Manufacturing businesses in China pumping out CO~2~ into the atmosphere have little or no obligation to pay for the damage that climate change causes in communities and countries across the world.  Resulting  Damage costs often can be ignored because they affect third parties and may be difficult to quantify, and difficult to locate the direct source for.   These costs are known as 'negative externalities'

Negative externalities can be accounted for (or 'internalised') if an economic actor has to pay for the cost of the damage via a tax.  This is known as a Pigouvian tax (after Arthur Pigou), and are thought to disincentivise the damage-causing economic activity. The idea is that people will be motivated to find less damaging alternatives to the polluting economic activities when these damage costs fall on them. They act not altruistically, but to reduce their tax bill [@Pigou1932].

There are some difficulties with applying Pigouvian taxes.  Pigouvian taxes can be difficult to quantify, costly to apply, and they may fall harder on those with lower incomes.  However, we may be able to use Pigouvian taxes to reduce other taxes, i.e. a 'Green Tax Shift'.  This could be particularly beneficial if they replace taxes on productive activities (a double-dividend).

# 12.1 Taxing Bads

The world faces a range of environmental problems which seem to be steadily getting worse. Ocean acidification, It is evident that these are mostly caused or worsened by human activity ^[Insert reference about human activity causing climate change]. We humans have developed bad habits that we cannot seem to break, often because there is no economic incentive to change. Why do we allow such tremendous environmental destruction to result from our economic activity, and why should we care? How could the tax system alter the balance of incentives?

Many of these environmental problems are caused by economic activity ^[actions involving the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services]. We are familiar with the example of effluent from a factory poisoning nearby waterways for the surrounding community.  This is possible because the factory doesn't have to pay for the damage they cause.  Another way of saying this is that the factory operators don't have to account for the full cost of their activities. 

If I chop down a forest to sell the timber, the price at which I sell it will account for my expenses incurred in chopping down the trees, the cost of my labour, and any permits required.  The price will *not* have accounted for the cost of destroying the ecological goods and services^[Ecological goods and services (EG&S) are the benefits arising from the ecological functions of ecosystems. Such benefits accrue to all living organisms, including animals and plants, rather than to humans alone.] [@LandStewardshipCentreofCanada2018] that the trees were providing to their local environment. 

The trees may have been slowing the rate of water run off and preserving soil structure. Now they are gone, the soil will be eroded faster  and the fertility of the land will be reduced. Further downstream, the flood-risk is increased and the productivity of irrigation infrastructure and a hydroelectric power project are reduced. These trees are no longer absorbing carbon dioxide from the air and storing the carbon in their biomass. If any of the timber is used as fuel, the stored carbon will be returned to the atmosphere in the form of Carbon Dioxide, so I have increased the atmospheric concentration of a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. 

Yet I have had to pay for none of the costs incurred by these damages. I do not pay to stabilise the soil, or for flood damages to the local village, or for the reduced productivity of farmland in the area. I simply did not have to consider these costs when I was judging whether it made economic sense for me to cut down the trees. 

There are a number of underlying reasons why environmental and social damages occur. Rational Choice Theory contends that it is because economic agents ^[individuals and institutions that engage in economic activity] tend only to consider costs to themselves.  Most, if not all, such damages tend to be incurred upon third parties and so the party causing the damage does not consider them.  This was the case in my (hypothetical) example in which I cut down the forest.  The damage I caused was suffered directly by others, so I didn't consider it.  

It is also the case that many damages do not immediately manifest or else are not plainly visible and so do not contribute to the knowledge that informs economic value. However, William Forster Lloyd's famous theory of the 'tragedy of the commons' [@Lloyd1833] suggests that even when resource users know that their activities will contribute to collective exploitation and are thus not in the common good, many independent individual actors will continue to pursue their own self-interest. 

The cost of raising and harvesting my trees, as well as the costs paid by the distributors and consumers of the timber, are examples of 'private costs'. They are costs incurred by participants of economic activity. We define the full cost of an activity, including damages caused, as the 'social cost' or 'damage cost'.  In the example above, the social cost is the cost to the soil, the atmosphere, the fisheries, the irrigation infrastructure, the hydroelectric project, flood security and other attendant costs. 

The difference between the two private costs and the social cost ' the costs that are left out of free market prices ' are called 'negative externalities'. 'Positive externalities' also exist where environmental or social benefit is provided by activities but not accounted for in prices. The benefit that a landowner gets from developments in nearby infrastructure, public services or the general economy, is an example of a positive externality ^['Positive externalities' also exist where environmental or social benefit is provided by activities but not accounted for in prices. The benefit that a landowner gets from developments in nearby infrastructure, public services or the general economy, is an example of a positive externality *received* by a private agent. Private agents can also *produce* positive externalities. An example of this might be a beautiful building or a cafe with charm and character. 

This concept was first put forward by a British economist, Arthur Cecil Pigou. In theory this makes for a very elegant and efficient solution to the puzzle. In practice there is a little more complexity involved, but, even so, Pigou certainly led us in the right direction towards recognising and rectifying damages to the environment and society caused by economic activity.

Pigou realised the tremendous implications of this discrepancy in prices. All kinds of activities that appear at first to be profitable might not really be profitable at all, once the full costs are included. We are allowing private profit literally at the expense of others who are damaged by such activity. This, he thought, is simply unacceptable. Pigou then devised a relatively simple solution.  All we have to do is calculate the value of the 'negative externality' and levy a tax of that amount so that the private cost is equivalent to the social cost. This is known as a Pigovian tax [@Pigou1932].

In theory, this makes for a very elegant and efficient solution to the puzzle. In practice,there is a little more complexity involved, but even so, Pigou certainly led us in the right direction towards recognising and rectifying damages to the environment and society caused by economic activity. 

# 12.2 Policy Options for Tackling Social and Environmental Damages

Pigou was particularly concerned that any damages caused to the environment or to people should be paid for. If we get prices right (so that they reflect full social costs), this will in turn discourage activities that would otherwise seem profitable despite causing external damage. 

 The polluter pays principle is 'the commonly accepted practice that those who produce pollution should bear the costs of managing it to prevent damage to human health or the environment' [@GranthamResearchInstituteonclimatechangeandtheenvironment2014]. This principle is the basis for most attitudes to the regulation of environmental pollution, forming part of the broader set of guidelines on the matter created in the 1992 Rio Declaration  [@UnitedNations1992].


The issue of externalities is of particular relevance to the conservation of natural resources and the environment. These resources - the land, the animals, the air - are vital to continued high quality human existence. If we strive to reflect the true costs of activities in prices, and properly manage these damaging activities, we will quite simply undermine the sustainability of the economy and our prosperity. 

However, it's not all bad news. Successful policy initiatives have been put in place to manage a variety of environmental and social issues - from the 5 pence bag 'Tax' to congestion charging in busy metropolitan centres. However, these current policy initiatives are not sufficient to tackle the large environmental problems and ensure our economies are developing in a sustainable manner. The figure below illustrates what has worked before, and areas for future development. 

|![image](OtherPictures/EnvironmentalInitiatives.png)|
|:--:|
|*Figure 12.3 Successful Environmental Initiatives*|


Sustainable development as defined by the Brundtland report is 'development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.'[@CommissiononEnvironment] Unless we act now to create policy tools to properly account for and manage environmental damage, it would definitely not be fair to future generations.

## Policy options

Pigouvian taxes are not the only weapons at our disposal to solve this problem.  There are a number of ways we could tackle negative externalities to address social and environmental damages.  

- We could ban or regulate the activities that cause harm ('command and control');

- We could directly or indirectly subsidise desirable behaviours;

- We could create market-based instruments (MBIs) which placing an overall limit on the damage we will allow,  and then distribute or sell tradable rights to contribute to the acceptable damage total ('cap-and-trade');

- We could levy taxes to discourage harmful activities, as Pigou suggested.

## Command-and-Control

The prohibition of ozone-damaging CFCs ^[Chlorofluorocarbons ' compounds that, when released into the atmosphere, damage the ozone layer that protects humans and other organisms] against damaging Ultraviolet (UV) light) in aerosols is an example of a successful command and control policy. It was effective because it applied to a specific production input (CFCs) that directly caused environmental damage, and because alternative substances were available for substitution. This latter quality meant there was minimal disruption to existing production in terms of input cost, design and manufacturing and other changes to supply. To put this another way, producers of aerosols could easily replace CFCs with other ingredients.

However this kind of solution would not work with many other kinds of environmental problems.  The combination of direct application of regulation to the damaging externality together with very contained and predictable economic effects is unusual within the scope of environmental externalities.  While 'command-and-control' solutions may appear to be the simplest and most direct ways to prevent or restrict damaging activities, the economic impacts tend to be complex and difficult to predict and measure in advance. In some cases, restricting one activity or product may simply cause it to be replaced with another that is equally or even more damaging, meaning net social costs are actually increased. In addition, regulatory mechanisms tend to be expensive to administer, meet high resistance from vested interests, and can be difficult to enforce. Stephen Shavell of Harvard University [@Shavell2011] presents a damning summation:

> *Conventional regulatory policies, which have not accounted for economic responses, have been excessively costly, ineffective, or even counterproductive... the 'tragedy of the commons' might be better described as the 'failure of commons regulation.* 

One possible way to reduce the effects of economic shocks of regulation is to introduce restrictions incrementally or with delayed effect, perhaps in conjunction with development subsidies. One can then observe early economic effects and give industry the chance to adapt and transition. Forward looking regulation can be extremely effective.

However, there are further reasons to seek alternatives to command-and-control approaches. As World Bank economist Staphano Pagiola and colleagues explain:

> '*while regulation can to some extent ensure basic compliance with minimum environmental and social requirements (although enforcement is usually far from perfect), use of positive incentives can unleash creativity and entrepreneurship which can lead to results far beyond the minimum.*' [@Pagiola2002]

## Subsidies

Subsidies for innovation and development are an obvious choice to generate positive incentives to protect the environment. As a widespread approach however, this would not only see an untenable strain on public finances, but would also represent an entirely backward logic. It would involve using tax revenue from labour and other productive activity to reduce damage that was inefficient or inappropriate to start with.

Our proposals operate in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle. It is a core tenet of this book that there should be a direct financial cost on damaging activities. This means that the burden for this damage falls on those that are responsible for it. This would not be achieved by a subsidy approach. We choose therefore not to include pure-subsidies in our proposals, but we do consider a tax-subsidy hybrid later on in this book. 

## Cap-and-Trade (Emissions Trading)

There still remains an alternative to taxation not yet considered: the emissions trading scheme or 'cap and trade' system. We consider this in the context of greenhouse gases. The current EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is an example of a 'cap-and-trade' system. It *caps* the total volume of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from installations and aircraft operators responsible for around half of EU GHG emissions. It then allows *trading* by affected firms of emission allowances so that the property rights to the collective total emissions are assigned to their most economically efficient use (i.e. the highest bidder). The aim is that collective total emissions remain within the cap, and the system acts as a least-cost mechanism to reduce emissions. If an emitting company undertakes measures to reduce their emissions to a level below their assigned portion of the amount permitted by the overall cap, they may sell the excess allowance to other firms. In this way, the market finds an appropriate 'damage cost' for these emissions, and incentivises technological advancement to find less polluting alternatives to current business practices that are affected by the scheme.

In theory this system works by assigning property rights to the ability to 'emit', and allows free trade amongst market participants to ensure these property rights are allocated in the most efficient way along the pareto frontier i.e. where no party can have a utility increase without decreasing the utility of another party. Simply put, people and firms that have the greatest need or desire to emit purchase the greatest number of permits from other economic actors who can reduce emissions or find less polluting alternative business practices.  In this simple model, free exchange leads to a 'pareto optimal division of goods' [@Allcott2018]. In reality however, the initial allocation of these property rights can often mean that although the outcome is economically efficient, it is distributionally unfair. 

The effect is to reduce the production-damage to companies that find it more costly to reduce emissions and to incentivise firms with a lower marginal cost associated with emissions-reduction to decrease their emissions more than it is required of them to do so. 

However, in practice the EU's ETS has highlighted the many pitfalls in this approach. In requiring international negotiations on the terms of the scheme (to ensure that there is a large and diverse enough market to make the system efficient), the ETS was watered down by lobby interests to the point whereby it has been barely effective at all. The cost of credits was too low to dramatically encourage decarbonisation, which was helped by the fact that most were allocated free of charge instead of being auctioned, and the overall base of the scheme covered only half of European GHG emissions. Subsequent iterations of the ETS system have improved on these issues, but it is a long, unwieldy process to fully internalise these externalities.

## Environmental Taxation

It is a core premise of this book we should tax unproductive and damaging activities instead of those that are wealth-creating. We are used to taxing goods, but we really should be taxing 'bads'! If we do this well, it is possible to reduce environmental and social externalities in ways that improve on or overcome the crucial shortcomings of command-and-control approaches, and also potentially confer additional benefits. 

Well-transitioned environmental taxes can achieve a system that is fair to industry and consumers and that provides sound incentives, whilst also covering the whole tax base.

We will explore this policy option in more detail in the section below as, for reasons of efficiency, ease of application, and incentivising potential technological developments, our proposals predominately focus on environmental taxes.



# 12.3 Taxing Negative Externalities 

As mentioned earlier, the concept of externalities was developed by British economist Arthur Pigou, after whom the term 'Pigouvian taxes' was named.  In simple terms, Pigou argued that the tax per unit of the pollution should equal the damage cost of that unit of pollution (assuming such a thing could be measured). Since the damage cost of a unit of pollution might vary in the quantity of pollution, we should clarify that this rate should normally be measured at the optimal quantity of pollution (that optimum being when overall benefits-costs are maximised). Once that tax had been imposed, the best allocation of resources in an economy could then be provided by the free market [@Pigou1932].

A 'marginal' cost is the cost increase in producing one additional unit of a product, i.e. in increasing the margin of production by one increment. A marginal damage cost is therefore the cost associated with the damage of producing one additional unit of the externality-causing product. For example, in the case of carbon dioxide (CO~2~) the marginal damage is the present value of future (worldwide) damages from an extra ton of emissions, accounting for the gradual uptake of CO~2~ from the oceans and delayed adjustment of temperatures to higher concentrations [@Parry2012]. These taxes are theoretically efficient solutions to environmental and social problems because they manipulate price mechanisms in order to modify activities, encouraging more efficient damage-reduction at a lower administrative cost.

## Calculating Damage Costs

It is notoriously difficult however to calculate damage costs, given that this involves evaluating complex systems with multiple feedbacks, predicting damages that have not yet happened, and including factors that are difficult to quantify and measure such as psychological impacts and aesthetic value. For example, to correctly tax a unit of CO~2~, we must know precisely how a unit increase in CO~2~ emitted today would affect social welfare at different points in the future [@Pagiola2002]. Yet the authors of a recent IMF working paper argue that inefficiency due to inaccurate damage costs may be overstated:

> *'Even if the tax is set at, say, 50 percent above or 50 percent below marginal damages, a large portion (roughly three-quarters) of the welfare gains from the true corrective tax are still achieved. Or put another way, given inherent imprecision in externality measurement, a tax that is 50 percent above or 50 percent below true marginal damages may still perform reasonably well in terms of expected welfare gains.'* [@Parry2012]

According to the IMF therefore, the measure of damage doesn't have to be exact for the Pigouvian tax to be effective. We will further discuss the difficulties and implications of accurately calculating externalities later in the chapter within the context of carbon taxes. First, we will complete our introductory review of Pigouvian taxes as the preferable means of internalising social costs, and explore criticisms they have faced and their potential to contribute to a tax system that better serves society and the environment. 

## Four Types of Environmental Taxes

In the UK, environmental taxes raised £48.0 billion in revenue in 2017, which as a percentage of GDP has remained fairly stable since the 1990s - sitting at around 2.2% to 2.8% of national GDP.  40% of these taxes fall on households, rather than companies, with 66% of household expenditure on environmental taxes relating to energy taxes and fuel duty. As for the corporations and services to which these taxes apply, those with high energy usage and transport fuel needs faced the next biggest tax burden. Such data indicates that clever and appropriate targeting of tax bases, alongside appropriate use of revenue to mitigate the regressive impacts of such taxes, is needed to ensure that these are sustainable. 



![Environmental Tax Revenue, ONS 2018](C:\Users\Heather Mckay\Documents\GitHub\TaxHeaven\taxheaven\ChapterPictures\11-EnvironmentalTaxRevenue.PNG)

However, taxes on fossil fuels and carbon content remain a significant proportion of these environmental taxes. OF the £48.0 billion raised, around 3/4 of this was sourced from energy taxes. Such taxes are defined as encompassing taxes on the production and use of energy products like petrol, gas and diesel. The largest single element of the revenue raised was from fuel duty, which applies to fossil fuels such as petrol and diesel. These taxes raised 57% of the total revenue from environmental taxes in 2017. 

Traditional views of environmental taxes are closely linked with climate change. Applying regulatory restrictions to air pollution and greenhouse gases have been the most prominent ways in which Pigouvian taxes have been used. However,  this perspective is highly limited, and the versatility of such policies underestimated. Despite the beneficial impacts from applying environmental taxes to carbon emissions, it must be stated that there are a myriad of other  externality targets to which taxes can, and have, be applied.

  Indeed, environmental taxes can be subdivided into four categories: energy, transport, pollution and resources [@ONS2018]. Examples could include pollution and resource regulation taxes, such as the the 1996 landfill tax. Since the introduction of these taxes, the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill in the UK has decreased by 28 million tonnes to 7.7 million tonnes in 2017. Such a reduction can not only be linked to the implementation of this landfill tax, as changing attitudes to recycling or exporting waste may have also had an impact, but it is clear to see that such taxes can have a significant impact on non-climate related pollution. Moreover, the introduction of the 5 pence bag tax in 2015 [@DEFRA2018] has seen a reduction in plastic bag use by 22% in the UK in two years. Nudge theory would suggest that by forcing people to consider and internalise the externality of taking another unnecessary bag, when on average each UK individual was estimated as having around 40 plastic bags already at home, this reduction was rapid and significant. 

Such taxes could also be applied to other 'social bads'. One pertinent example for anyone living in London could be the example of congestion. The city of London has been a pioneer in this area, applying several different scales of congestion taxes to ensure that the city does not being gridlocked, or increased in its levels of dangerous air pollution. In combination with successful provision of affordable public transport, the London congestion tax - introduced in 2003 - has seen a reduction in congestion in central London by 26% in 2006 from the 2002 levels [@CentreforPublicImpact2016]. Other tangential benefits included the reduction in accidents of around 40-70% in the designated zone, and the generation of significant public revenues. 

# 12.4 Addressing Inequity

Pigouvian taxes have sometimes been criticised for being regressive (disproportionately affecting the less-well-off) and exacerbating social inequity. For example, a flat-rate tax in the United States on carbon might appear to be unfair because data suggests that the percentage of income going to fossil fuel consumption in the lowest decile of income is 10.1% versus 1.5% in the highest decile (Shome, 1995). This is to say that a greater proportion of poor people's income is spent on fossil fuels than that of wealthy people. However, these figures may be affected by the way income is calculated. 

The effect of any specific environmental tax on lower-income households might be evaluated by considering a combination of impacts;

- The direct impact when the price of the taxed good rises and affects household expenditures

- The indirect impact of price increases when taxed goods are used in production of other goods

- The net impact given any improvement in the environment and its effect on welfare and given behavioural changes resulting from changes in the price of the taxed good [@OECD2011]

## How should revenue be used?

Another important decision affecting the overall social benefit of Pigouvian taxes concerns what should happen to the revenues that are raised. If the tax is regressive, it may be seen as appropriate to use some of the income to provide subsidies that protect low-income households from price increases. However, the effect of this equates to simply exempting some people from the tax  who nonetheless contribute to the externality.  They are not, therefore, incentivised to change their behaviour. This runs counter to the Pigouvian ideal because it reduces the overall effectiveness of the tax. The Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), a major intergovernmental organisation promoting trade and economic progress, advises that:

> *'Attempting to address both environmental issues and distributional concerns within the tax itself risks undermining the ability of the tax to do either. For example, an exemption for low-income families from a tax on heating fuel eliminates the incentive otherwise provided to economise on fuel use and to consider alternatives...*
>
> *...Where there are significant negative impacts on, for example, low-income people, these usually are better addressed by other redistributive policy responses*'. 

Some welfare-enhancing options could be to allocate money to public services, or invest in economic growth such that society as a whole is better-off. Alternatively, we could make the tax revenue-neutral by using the money raised to lower other kinds of taxes. This would have the potential to address equity concerns. Economists have also discussed how this kind of 'revenue-recycling' could also make the economy work better by reducing taxes that are damaging to production, thus leading to a 'double-dividend'.   

## The 'Double Dividend'

Labour taxes are often criticised for their distortionary qualities because, while central to government revenue, they effectively punish people for working in that they reduce people's effective income and their resultant  welfare. Such taxes also affect the 'work versus leisure' judgements of individuals that are assumed to determine people's willingness to work, and in turn impact the overall labour supply. In increasing the marginal cost of labour, they can also have a negative impact on employment. These issues were explored in the Core Tax System chapter. Our concern here is to review the viability of using such revenues from environmental taxes to reduce the impact of distortionary taxes such as these.

Parthasrathi Shome of the International Monetary Fund argues that:

>  *'The attractiveness of garnering a double dividend, of reduced environmental damage and revenue without social cost from environmental taxes,should not be underestimated. Many estimates for the United States suggest that the marginal welfare cost of taxation is about one third or higher. Thus taxes such as carbon taxes which have relatively large tax bases, could dramatically improve the efficiency with which revenues are raised.'** [@ParthasarathiShome]

However others have argued that because environmental taxes tend to raise the cost of producing output (thus reducing labour supply and investment) they in fact may exacerbate the efficiency costs associated with tax distortions in labour and capital markets. This means that that the perceived efficiency benefits from revenue-recycling could be outpaced [@Pagiola2002].It has been suggested that if the negative tax-interaction effect does exceed the positive effect of revenue-recycling, the real-world Pigouvian rate should thus be set somewhat lower than its theoretical optimal in order to compensate, making a tax both revenue and efficiency-neutral, but no longer environmentally optimal [@Bovenberg2001]

One study assessed the potential for recycling revenues to reduce labour taxes in order to reduce unemployment, and concluded that a positive effect would depend on very special conditions, specifically that the impact of the tax on after-tax profits is low [@Boehringer2004] Similarly, another concluded that employment benefits would depend on the initial Pigouvian tax rate being lower than the wage tax rate [Koskela, 1998].

Ideally, the distorting effects of individual proposed taxes and the potential of revenue recycling need to be properly evaluated before a judgement can be made on a case-by-case basis. Doing so is complicated by the difficulty of assessing deadweight losses. 

## Coordinated Resource Rent Taxes as LVT at a distance

One thing that is missing from this discussion is the possibility of coordination amongst fossil fuel importing countries to reduce the pre-tax price of fossil fuels. It may seem perverse but to prevent fossil fuels being extracted, their pretax price should fall below the cost of production. This means that the'resource rent'would be reduced to zero. 

An internationally-coordinated tax on resource rents (e.g. oil and other fossil fuels) is therefore something of a 'super-LVT'. It's as efficient as a land value tax, but more so because it prevents the flow of resource rents out of the country.  It is the opposite of the 'oil price shock' of the 1970s. It could be used to subsidise efficient urban transportation, which is also likely to have positive co-benefits. 

## The Perfect Market: Should We Reduce Deadweight Loss at All Costs?

A market with no distortion whatsoever 'a perfect market' is theoretically created by the conditions of 'perfect competition'. Taxes and externalities both represent distortions that defy these conditions, but there are other factors involved when attempting to evaluate net distortion effects from a new tax.

Perfect competition (the market optimum) also relies on perfect information (producers and consumers know prices and the benefit of ownership), there being a large number of buyers and sellers, on no firms having market power to set prices above marginal cost (whereby they could raise prices without losing as many customers to competitors as they should), and on factors of production being fully internationally mobile. It also relies on the assumption that the economic behaviour of individuals is perfectly rational, i.e. people always optimise the benefit they get from their transactions. It also assumes that people are predictable. This is a core assumption of 'rational actor theory' that lies at the heart of neoclassical economics. It is well beyond the scope of this chapter to critique this theory, but it is sufficient to make two key remarks.

First, accurately assessing deadweight loss approaches impossibility when given incomplete knowledge and multiple factors influencing net distortion effects, more so when we can question whether or not some factors are even theoretically predictable. 
Second, and more importantly, to place the primary impetus on reducing the absolute magnitude of deadweight losses incurred by taxation is to assume both that perfect competition creates the welfare maximum across society, and that any lessening of distortions from that ideal is necessarily desirable. If that assumption were held consistently, it would also follow that governments would levy no taxes on labour at all, or indeed on any elastic factor of production (i.e. factors for which a change in price affects the level of supply or demand). 
In this book we argue for a shift in the overall tax-base toward things that are inelastic in both supply and demand, but not for the  shrinkage of the state because some level of redistribution is necessary to provide an acceptable standard of welfare for all. Also, if we take the example of a progressive tax that disproportionately affects the better-off and redistributes benefits to the less-well-off, the overall welfare gains to society may be increased even though the amount of economic distortion has increased.

These points serve to demonstrate that the reduction of economic distortions,including the deadweight loss of taxation, is only desirable in so far as that reduction represents welfare gains to society as a whole, most notably through redistribution benefits.


# 12.5 A Green Tax Shift

We are proposing that a broad suite of environmental taxes should represent a 'green tax shift'in the UK tax system, whereby increased taxes on resources to internalise environmental and social damages can be accompanied by reduced taxes on labour. This notion resonates with the ideas of Dutch entrepreneur Eckart Wintzen for a 'value extracted tax', which taxes the value that a certain product or raw material extracts from the environment through human use [@VanKamp2003]. Wintzen proposed that such a tax could form the basis of a new system that promoted services above material goods. These ideas have become the basis of the Ex'Tax project, which has explored how such measures might operate across the tax system and provided a case study plan for implementing such a scheme in the Netherlands [@Groothuis2014].

There is a potential issue with replacing labour taxes with environmental taxes in the potential that this has to undermine the stability of government revenue. If an environmental tax discourages a certain kind of behaviour, that tends to reduce returns to the treasury. If a tax rate is linked to damage costs under evolving circumstances and shifting behaviour, it is dynamic and possibly more difficult to rely on than is a levy on labour. Ex'Tax respond to this difficulty with diversity, setting out abroad range of environmental taxes that collectively help to secure stable revenues. Taxes on energy and natural resources are relatively inelastic compared to labour taxes, which means that there is room to increase the rates without causing a decrease in government income. 

Ex'Tax also point out that the assumption that labour is a reliable and stable source of government income no longer holds as true as it once did. We live in a globalising world in which jobs move across the globe, and high rates of unemployment, ageing populations and increasing health costs all weaken the stability of traditional labour tax revenues. This reality is certainly applies to the UK [@TUC2017] where the growth of insecure employment is estimated to cost the Exchequer '£4bn a year. For the case study in the Netherlands, the group outline a $33.7b shift in the national tax base from labour to natural resources and consumption. Below is a summary of the measures they suggest: 

| **Decreases in  Labour Taxes**                               | **Increases in  Natural Resource & Consumption Taxes**       |

# 12.6 Focusing Tax: The Case of Vehicle Emissions

The difficulties of assessing true damage costs have led to two common adaptations to the original Pigouvian ideal. 

- The first is to use direct taxes that are aimed at meeting specific regulatory standards and priced according to abatement costs rather than set according to the full cost of the externality per-se. In theory this can provide a degree of choice to damaging agents to either pay the tax or (if it is better value) to reduce damages, or a combination of both. If the tax is set high enough, it will be an effective way to meet specific damage-reduction targets. There can be issues if the costs borne by agents are significantly unequal, which we will discuss later in the context of carbon taxes. 

- The second response has been for policymakers to impose consumption taxes on goods that are implicated in environmental damages, rather than directly taxing the sources of the externalities or targets that are commensurate with the damage (where damage increases in direct proportion to the amount of activity undertaken or product used). The issues with this approach are outlined this section using the example of fuel taxes.


Policies to reduce vehicle emissions provide a useful set of examples for us to explore the question of where best to target taxes. Vehicles arguably generate at least eight externalities. 

1. Vehicles emit carbon dioxide emissions, which contribute to the greenhouse effect. 
2. Vehicles use petroleum products (petrol or diesel) which are imported (or use products which could be exported) from unstable and authoritarian countries. This is costly in financial and political terms and has security implications (Sallee, 2011)
3. Vehicles pollute the local air, harming people and the environment
4. Driving contributes to traffic congestion, which slows down other road-users. 
5. Vehicle use increases risk of accidental injury to pedestrians, cyclists, animals, other motorists and accidental damage to property. 
6. Driving wears down road surfaces and increases other infrastructure maintenance costs.
7. Roads use high-value land that could be used for other purposes.
8. The construction and maintenance of roads costs money that could otherwise be allocated elsewhere.

Given that the first two externalities are directly proportional to the volume of fuel consumed (assuming conventional petrol or diesel fuels. Biofuels complicate the overall emissions flux). Their ideal Pigouvian solution is a fuel tax. Taxing fuel directly will discourage its use leading to efficient reduction in those damages. Given that emissions vary with fuel use (because they are also factors of engine efficiency, road surface etc.), the optimal solution here is an emissions tax,but that would be impractical given current technologies [@Anderson2011]. However, a fuel tax still has an estimated two-thirds of the benefits of an optimal tax on emissions [@Fullerton2000].

Congestion is linked to overall vehicle use but is strongly focused on busier times and locations, so a time- and place-based congestion charge, such as has been introduced in London, is the most effective practical solution. However, congestion charging would only be optimised if it accounted for all times and places that congestion occurs, imposing responsive per-mile tolls on congested roads, which may become more feasible with future monitoring technology [@Parry2012]. Injury risk is a composite of a suite of factors including overall mileage,average speed, weather conditions, prevalence of other road-users, and safe driving technique. It therefore evades an optimal tax, but is certainly correlated with overall vehicle use, so its reduction is aligned with taxes that incentivise reduced vehicle use. Infrastructure use and wear is optimally addressed with a mileage tax. The current system of road tax is unfair because it charges all road-users within the same tax-band evenly despite widely different levels of road-use. The tax-band system itself is a form of tax on fuel economy, which is intended to incentivise the use of more fuel-efficient vehicles to reduce pollution effects. This is also flawed.

A US study of tax policy and fuel economy concluded that:

> *'Fuel economy taxation shares the weaknesses of fuel economy regulation in that it induces a 'rebound effect' by lowering the cost of driving, which erodes gasoline savings and increases congestion and accident externalities...* 
>
> *...while they do work to improve vehicle fuel economy,the same goals could be achieved at a lower cost to society if policy makers instead directly taxed fuel'* [@Anderson2011]

These eight externalities, taken together, drive us towards some conclusions on vehicle taxes. We support per-mile congestion charges, once appropriate supportive technology becomes available. In the meantime they should be rolled out across cities and other major areas for congestion. We suggest that that the existing road tax with a band system based on engine capacity, plus the existing vehicle excise duty (VED) with exemptions for low-emission vehicles, are inefficient at reducing emissions and can cause rebound effects. Replacing both with a fuel tax would retain universal incentives to reduce vehicle use, (excepting electric vehicles, but they would still be equally liable to pay congestion charges) increase manufacturer incentives to improve fuel efficiency to meet consumer demand, and create a more efficient system for emissions-reduction. The example of vehicle emissions highlights the importance of recognising where multiple externalities are associated with a product or activity and of assessing appropriate optimisation of tax effectiveness.

A fuel tax is a type of consumption tax, and consumption taxes can be very effective at driving consumer behaviour whilst being efficient Pigouvian taxes if a large proportion of the externalities tackled are confined within a particular sector or product class. If an externality has multiple sources ' many ways in which the same kind of damages occur across different types of activity ' such a tax will not be optimal unless it tackles all of those sources. 

An important environmental purpose of a fuel tax would be to reduce pollution emissions, and a key category within those emissions are greenhouse gases. Yet in the UK, emissions from road transport represent just a quarter of overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CCC, 2016) so a fuel tax only tackles a quarter of the damaging activities responsible for GHG emissions. So should we not just add taxes on the other causes of GHG emissions?  We should certainly tax those things, but for an effective Pigouvian tax, we need to ensure that the price attributed to the externality itself (the marginal damage cost) is consistently commensurate with the marginal tax rate. In other words, the tax imposed on the other GHG sources needs to be the same, per unit of damage, as the fuel tax. What we need is a price for GHG emissions per unit and a way to apply that cost across all sources.

# 12.7 Opportunities and Challenges of a Carbon Tax

There is an overwhelming consensus in the scientific community that anthropogenic (human-created) GHG emissions are leading to increasing global average temperatures through the greenhouse-effect. Atmospheric CO~2~ is by far the largest contributor to the rapid rate of warming that must be stemmed rapidly if we are to avoid a suite of climate-related issues. 

> '*The most important anticipated consequences of climate change are changes in precipitation, decreased snowpack, glacier melting, droughts in mid to low latitudes, decreased cereal crop productivity at lower latitudes, increased sea level, loss of islands and coastal wetlands,increased flooding, greater storm intensity, species extinction, and spread of infectious disease... Estimates of economic impacts of unrestrained climate change vary, with most falling in the range of one to three percent of world GDP per year by the middle of the current century (with large regional differences), assuming 4C warming*' [@Shavell2011].

There is therefore a global imperative, including a strong economic argument, for large systemic changes to our activities to meet these challenges. Yet, even a staunch climate skeptic can find very good reason to support a well-designed fiscal policy on carbon. Fossil fuels, the primary source of current CO~2~ emissions, are non-renewable resources, so there is a need to transition to renewable energy sources for medium to ensure long-term energy security. A well-designed carbon plan can catalyse that transition and help to incentivise the innovation and early-adoption of sustainable energy technologies. Further to this, the approach we propose can lead to significant welfare gains for every citizen because of the shift in state revenues it can help to facilitate. 

## The difficulty of calculating the external costs of Carbon emissions

Because of the sheer unpredictability of the integrated feedbacks between the earth-system and social and economic responses, given unprecedented climate change, compounded by the difficulties of distributing the burden of spending along a projected future timeline, the problem of estimating damage costs is found here at its zenith. Estimations of the external costs of carbon emissions vary hugely and find little consensus. For example, one study placed the cost of a ton of CO~2~ at over \$300 USD [@Stern2006a] while another suggested a much more modest tax of \$30 per ton of carbon, increasing to about \$85 USD in 2050 [@Nordhaus2007]. Gregory Mankiw, Professor of Economics at Harvard University, explains an important quirk of the economics of projected costs:

> '*Suppose I were to tell you that some event 'it could be global warming, or it could be a falling meteor ' is going to lower permanently real GDP by 100 billion starting one century from now. How much would you pay today to avoid that future event? The answer depends on how you trade off dollars today against dollars in the future, which is measured by the discount rate. At a discount rate of 1 percent per year, you would be willing to pay 3.7 USD trillion today. At a discount rate of 5 percent per year, the answer is a mere $15 billion. Plausible changes in the rate of discount can easily change the answer by more than 100-fold. This simple numerical example goes to the heart of a difficult problem: the issue of global warming involves taking costly actions today to avoid adverse outcomes that will occur far in the future. Economists have not yet figured out the best way to calibrate that trade-off.*'[@Mankiw2009]

The models that economists build to simulate the social cost of carbon (SCC) are known as 'integrated assessment models' (IAMs). They combine a climate science model, describing GHG emissions and their impact on temperature, with an economic model, which includes projections of abatement costs and a description of how changes in climate affect output,consumption, and other economic variables. Many are not convinced that these models are reliable.  In a (2013) review of IAMs to date, Robert Pindyck, MIT Professor of Economics, concluded that:

> *'The models are so deeply flawed as to be close to useless as tools for policy analysis.'*  [@Pindyck2013]

## Trying a different approach: Choosing a set level for CO~2~

If we cannot rely on these models, how can we hope to get the price of a carbon tax right? We need to bark up a different tree. Instead of persisting with the impossible task of estimating CO~2~ damage costs, we should instead say that the marginal tax rate could perhaps most feasibly be set to equal the marginal cost of reducing CO~2~ to a set level ^[Here we talk of CO~2~ prices as a direct tax on the causes of emissions that also discourages the unsustainable extraction of high-carbon natural resources] as determined by reviewing national 'carbon budget' emissions targets as part of commitments to longer-term goals set in multinational agreements under the Kyoto Protocol. So, instead of attempting to evaluate the full costs of a complex system of damages and feedbacks, we are then faced with a somewhat more manageable question of the short-term cost of reducing net emissions to a more acceptable level. This would be the first stage of an eventual transition to a carbon-neutral economy, in which growth would induce zero net gain in the atmospheric carbon pool. Depending on the time this takes, it may be necessary to move to a position of net sequestration in order to bring the desired stability to the climate. 

The cost of reducing net CO~2~ emission to a set level can be approached from two angles. On the one hand are the costs of reducing the current rate of human-caused emissions (abatement costs), and on the other are the costs involved in increasing the rate at which atmospheric carbon is captured and stored (sequestration costs). Consider for a moment that we could calculate both the available sequestration capacity and the marginal cost of additional sequestration. If we did this we would know how much it would cost to capture an additional ton of carbon from the atmosphere and store it such that it is not contributing to the greenhouse effect. We could use this knowledge and this potential capacity to increase sequestration to make an offer to CO~2~ emitters using the tax system. An emitter could choose either to reduce their emissions to the required level (and incur abatement costs), or to pay for the service of having the equivalent carbon sequestered (pay the tax), or some combination of the two, according to relative costs. 

This would mean that whatever happens, the emissions target will be reached, and the price attributed to carbon as a marginal damage cost is accurately equated to the cost of negating the damage, i.e. once the target moves to zero net emissions the tax would be one-hundred percent efficient at internalising the externality. However, it is obvious that the feasibility of this policy is dependent on two key conditions. 

- If the sequestration cost is too high, such that it completely exceeds emitters' abatement costs, the resulting high carbon tax rate could leave emitters with no option but to bear the full up-front costs of abatement. The economic shock of this would likely cause a lot of damage to production, including rendering firms bankrupt. Similarly, if the sequestration cost was much lower than most firms' abatement costs, there would be no incentive to decarbonise production and the concurrent benefits for promoting sustainable resource-use would be lost. This scenario is much less likely than the first for the foreseeable future. 

- There must be enough capacity for additional sequestration to meet the demand, otherwise the target would not be met or the carbon price would be inflated ^[The scenario of a sequestration supply capacity that is both smaller than demand and cheap to provide, with appropriate supply: demand and abatement: sequestration cost ratios supporting only a moderate carbon price increase seems highly unlikely. Therefore, we assume supply must be able to meet demand]. Therefore, the most feasible scenario in which this system would work would involve additional sequestration capacity that can be provided at an acceptable and relatively stable price. 

There is considerable future promise for establishing sequestration services which could allow us to set a carbon dioxide price that reflects the cost of negating the emissions externality, and is not simply based on guesswork regarding the damage costs. 

For a practical transition policy, we could implement a broad-based carbon tax at a relatively moderate rate which increases with time. There are several reasons for starting with a lower rate. First, it would establish that there is a social cost of carbon, and that social cost must be internalized in the prices that consumers and firms pay [@Pindyck2013]. Second, it gives polluting firms time to adapt to abatement and develop new technologies toward that end. Third, it allows us to monitor economic impacts more gradually rather than introducing a large shock with unpredictable consequences. 

However we need go one step further. A major issue with even a moderate carbon tax is that it will increase domestic electricity prices. The risk is that we'll end up paying more for our household bills until renewable low-carbon energy sources become cheaper. So called 'feed-in tariffs' have been used in the UK and other European countries to subsidise low-carbon energy sources in the short term, but these are falling out of favour because of their cost. There is potential here to kill two birds with one stone. When we introduce our carbon tax, we could also introduce an electricity subsidy. This would mean that all producers would receive a subsidy payment per unit of electricity produced. Those hit by the carbon tax, the fossil-fuel power stations, would initially have some of those costs mitigated,while low-carbon sources would receive the same subsidy for electricity without having to pay the tax. Over time this subsidy would reduce and eventually be removed, but meanwhile we will have incentivised a smooth transition to low-carbon energy without hitting household bills.  

The UK in fact already has a form of small carbon tax in place, called the 'carbon price floor', which was introduced in 2013, and is set as a 'top-up' tax on top of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)  ^[(HMRC, July 2016)] [@Grover2016]. Howevrer it does not apply to all domestic imports and, in particular, it does not apply to imports. As Dieter Helm of the University of Oxford explains:

> *'The UK and EU targets are all based upon production and not consumption. They therefore do not link in any clear way to the CO~2~ ppm[parts per millimetre] concentrations at the global level. Hence the abatement cost measures are not strictly carbon ones...*
>
> *...it is possible to hit the domestic production targets whilst at the same time increasing global emissions.'* [@Helm2009]

To be comprehensive and effective, then, a carbon tax must have a broad tax-base. In other words,it should apply to many things rather than just a few select areas. It also needs to actively incentivise decarbonisation. The carbon emissions implicated in producing most of the products we consume in this country occur in other jurisdictions, because those products are imported. The UK runs a trade deficit, which means we import more than we export. In 2015 we exported £284 billion and imported £411 billion of goods ^[ONS, 2016]. A carbon tax would ideally cover the emissions implicated in all of the goods we produce as well as the goods we import. These CO~2~ emissions resulting from the production, transport and use of goods are known as 'embodied emissions'.

Next we ask what would happen if we started taxing embodied emissions and increased the rate of the carbon tax to better incentivise decarbonisation.

# 12.8 Borders and Competition: Making a National-Level Carbon Tax Feasible

If we levy a moderate carbon tax on goods and services produced in the UK as a standalone policy, it will negatively affect domestic competition in international markets. We will have incorporated the carbon externality into pricing, but other jurisdictions may not have, or may have to differing amounts, so while our price is 'right', the global market price will be lower and UK firms will struggle to compete. 

We could potentially avoid this issue by having a carbon tax based on consumption, not production. If we do not impose the carbon tax on things produced in this country, but we do impose a tax to reflect the embodied carbon of things consumed here, there are fewer unfair negative competition effects for UK firms. It would, however, drive competition between both domestic and foreign firms that supply the UK market to reduce embodied emissions and thus reduce the price to consumers. Taxing UK consumption but not UK production would also be likely to drive exports, which in turn would be good for our economic growth.

In an ideal world this would actually be doing things the wrong way around. An 'upstream' carbon tax, at the point of extraction, refinement, or electricity production, is the most efficient tax base, because the carbon stored in fossil fuels can be precisely quantified and taxed without having to calculate embodied emissions. This would also lead to savings in administration costs of the tax. A system of rebates could incentivise the development of 'downstream' emissions capture technology [@Parry2012]. The ideal for global CO~2~ emissions reduction is to arrange a global price for carbon that is taxed upstream. International coordination toward this end should be promoted. 

However, for now we need to find an approach that works on a national level. Because of the efficiency losses and generally high administrational costs of downstream tax bases relative to upstream bases, it is still desirable for us to impose a carbon tax on domestic production in high-carbon industries, rather than taxing at the point of consumption, but in order to negate the international competitive effect, we would also need a subsidy on exports, which could simply be arranged as a tax refund. Imports would need to be taxed based on embodied carbon in order to correct for the domestic carbon tax. Systems like this are known as 'border tax adjustments' (BTAs).

## Border Tax Adjustments: Feasible and Legal?

Concerns have been raised in discussions about the feasibility of these policies. We address some of them here.

## Complexity and Administrational Cost

Our proposed BTA system is very simple in principle. The greatest complexity comes in assessing the embodied carbon of imports. To do this thoroughly would require consideration of the tax policies of all countries exporting to the UK in order to assess the extent to which embodied emissions of imports have already been taxed under other jurisdictions. We suggest that this is indeed a messy affair and we should instead tax imports according to the full embodied carbon cost, regardless of the effect of policies of the exporting country. As more exporting countries respond to the subsequent incentive to reduce embodied emissions, the rates charged at our borders could be uniformly decreased.

A fairer alternative system to this gradual rate reduction would be to form mutual agreements with other nations that also impose a tax on embodied emissions of imports, such that both sides refund these taxes at the border. However, such an arrangement could be considered a violation of international trade agreements because it would mean offering preferential treatment to some trading partners but not others.

## WTO and GATT Legality

The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is multilateral agreement between 128 countries (including the UK) on the terms of fair international trade, and is regulated by the World Trade Organisation (WTO). A detailed analysis by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment found that in principle BTAs seem to be acceptable under GATT, and it is permissible to impose a tariff on imports concurrent with a subsidy on exports of comparable goods and services.

 A central tenet of the agreements is that there is no policy discrimination for imports based on country of origin, but the authors argue that there are exceptions written into the agreement that might be feasibly invoked with the justification of protecting the environment as a global resource [@Hilbert2009].

# 12.9 Resource Rents

Resource rents represent unearned income in the form of natural resources yet to be extracted. Resource revenues are different to general government revenues in two key ways. First, revenues are volatile because they are driven largely by volatile commodity prices, and they are, in principle, temporary. Secondly, natural resources represent the commons: all citizens have an equal claim on them, and unlike income-based government revenues, they have not been appropriated from anyone so represent 'distributions' as opposed to 'redistributions' [@Segal2012].

However, a large body of work suggests that having a large resource sector has adverse affects on a country's economy, institutions and politics. These effects are collectively known as the 'resource curse [@Ploeg2011]. A key part of these arguments is that resource revenues are frequently misused, wasted, or lost to corruption [@Segal2012]. A statistical review found that in general resource wealth does not  cause poor institutional or political outcomes such as a tendency for authoritarianism [@Haber2011]^[What is being said here?]. Resource rents also have significant potential to increase the welfare of citizens, if correctly managed.

The notion of 'resource nationalism', in the sense that resources belong to the country in which they are located and should be used for that country's benefit, is a principle codified in numerous international treaties on human rights. This is actually a relatively recent development. Paul Segal of King's College London explains this historic shift [@Segal2012]:

> *'The twentieth century saw a dramatic reorientation of resource ownership rights. First the principle that subsoil resources are owned by governments as opposed to private landowners was settled in almost all countries (private land in the US being the only major exception), with private agents gaining access to them through regulated contracts...*
>
> *...More dramatically, decolonisation led to an assertion of the rights of developing country governments and a massive swing in bargaining power in their favour, away from the international mining companies and their rich-country owners that had dominated the industry. The development of national oil and mining companies was part of this trend.'* 

In some parts of the world, resource rents have been used to create schemes known as 'severance tax trust funds', which have specific remits to invest in projects for various kinds of public benefit. The Alaska Permanent Fund, created in 1976, is perhaps the best-known example. The fund pays a per-capita dividend to citizens, based on the principle of common ownership. Severance tax trust funds are also in place in Montana, New Mexico, Utah, North Dakota and Wyoming.

Philosopher Thomas Pogge has advanced an alternative vision for resource rents that is based not on resource nationalism, but resource globalism. Pogge presented his idea of a 'global resources dividend' as a means of tackling global poverty [@Pogge1998]. However, such a system would require significant international coordination, and critics have suggested the distributive effects could anyway harm poor nations that are not resource-rich [@Hayward2005].  We propose that UK resource rents could help contribute to a national citizen's dividend.
