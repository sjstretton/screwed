# WHERE ARE WE NOW? FACING A PERFECT STORM.

The film 'A Perfect Storm' describes the true story of a fishing trawler facing an epic storm. 

A group of New England fishermen had fallen on hard times after a series of poor catches. Their captain, played in the film by the actor George Clooney, hired a boat for one final fishing trip of the year. The trawler sailed out into the mid-Atlantic. After much fruitless searching, they finally struck fish. Turning for home, they hoped to get the catch back whilst still fresh. Unfortunately, a storm was brewing - and not just any storm. Three separate weather systems had merged to create a 'weather bomb' of unusual intensity. Meteorologists warned of a serious threat to life.  

The fishermen faced a dilemma. Should they attempt to land their catch whilst still fresh? To do so, they would need to risk their lives by sailing back on a direct route, straight through the storm. Alternatively, they could avoid the storm by sailing further out to sea. After this detour, the fish would no longer be fresh, and they would be out of pocket.

Added to this dilemma were communication and leadership issues. The storm had damaged the radio, making it difficult to get information or call for help. The captain (we'll call him 'Clooney' after the actor playing him), whilst charismatic, lacked good judgment. He took the risk and sailed into the storm.

Taking a step back from their immediate plight, it seems odd that Clooney and his men took such a severe risk. Why were they in that situation in the first place? Perhaps there are two reasons.

First, the seas were no longer as bountiful as they once were. In the 1950s, the Grand Banks off Newfoundland teemed with fish. But overfishing led to a collapse in stocks. Thus our crew needed to go further out to sea, where more plentiful stocks remained. Second, the fishermen lacked economic security in their lives. They had to fish to keep food on the table. Beyond their own homes, they owned little. The boat was owned by an investor who expected a return without doing anything quite so dangerous as heading out to sea.

What has the 'Perfect Storm' got to do with the future of the planet? On Earth, we are facing a similar situation to Clooney and his crew. There are warnings of a dangerous future for us all. Climate scientists warn of a much hotter planet with more intense storms and rising seas. Should we ignore the warnings and steam ahead, like Clooney, or recognise the dangers we face and try to mitigate them?

Even if we accept these warnings, the situation remains tricky. You and I have little control over the direction of the world economy. There is no single captain of the 'Good Ship Earth.' Indeed, most of us have little idea how  exactly the controls of our economy work. 

This book is about a centrally important set of controls which direct the focus and trajectory of our economy: Taxation. In this book, we show how changes to the tax system could be made to shift the economy towards a brighter future. We link taxation to substantive concerns of our daily lives and our long-term collective future, including welfare benefits, property rights, wealth accumulation, environment, energy and housing policy.

A critic might argue that people's interests and actions are their own business. People should be free to do what they want, without the government interfering. Anyway, hasn't the market economy had a good record? Globally, humanity is richer, more secure, and living longer than ever before. Poverty is also at record low levels. 

There is a lot of truth in these observations - but there are storm clouds on the horizon. This book investigates two major issues that threaten our future. The first is environmental damage. The second is economic insecurity. The richer and more populous humanity is, the more environmental damage we cause. The more unequal society becomes, the more we risk the hard-fought stability developed during the latter half of the twentieth century. Unless we learn better habits, we will damage the one planet that we have, and destroy the basic social consensus on which our system depends.  

Young people are working harder just to stay still. In 1996, 93% of individuals with a deposit were able to afford to buy their own home in England. This number fell to 61% in 2016, with over 40% of young adults unable to buy homes at all in their local area [@BBC2018]. Issues like these - concerns about the affordability of a decent lifestyle for ordinary people - are among the economic phenomena that motivated us to write this book. The basic question we ask is: How could we reform the tax system so that it is truly fair and effective in delivering the results that matter to people? Being able to afford a decent place to live, being rewarded in proportion to one's contributive merit, and being assured of a safe and stable global climate and sea-level are among the results that really matter.

There's one more crucial question: How can we decide on and make these changes together? The members of Clooney's crew had different preferences. Some wanted to get home swiftly; others wanted to stay out at sea and avoid the storm. But the fate of the crew was indivisible. No-one was in a position to exit the boat earlier than the others, or take a different route. They had to decide together and so live or die together. The fate of humanity is similar. Whatever our individual preferences, we also face issues in common. We need to understand the controls of our economy so we can shift its trajectory in a safer direction. If our society is analogous to Clooney's boat, our economy is akin to the boat's engine, and our taxation system is its rudder. That's why our focus in this text is on the British economy's control systems: not just on the rudder, but on the processes for deciding to shift the rudder in one direction or another.  

Throughout our analysis, we steer clear of the god-like perspective of meteorologists, with their satellites and computer models, and constrain our analysis to the very 'human' perspective of Clooney and his men. We therefore leave aside any investigation into proving whether the meteorologists and climate scientists are right about the dangers of rising atmospheric carbon levels. That issue is within scope of many other texts - and we've read enough of them to be very confident that climate science isn't a hoax. (We recommend the website skepticalscience.com for good and easy-to-read information about climate science, and rebuttals of mistaken talking-points often repeated by 'climate skeptics.') We proceed from the credible assumption that these threats are very real, and deeply significant. The storm, in other words, is strong and rising. It will get much fiercer in years to come. 

The trawler and the fishermen combine a mechanical and a social system. In determining its fate, what mattered was not only how well the boat's engine and rudder, was working but also how well Clooney was directing the crew. It's similar with our economy and the political system that guides it. Our analysis accordingly considers two major economic questions: How to prevent environmental destruction; and what constitutes a just distribution of wealth and property. In both cases, we're interested in taxation as set of controls over the economy and the consequent human impact on the world.

We can phrase these questions in economic and political terms. The economist would ask: Why do pollution and economic insecurity persist amidst such wealth? Is there a remedy to these ills? The politician may ask: How can we change course together? We are in the same boat, after all. There is only one planet that we all sit on, one biosphere of which we are all living parts - and as a species, we are, for better or worse, now the most powerful force guiding its fate.

However, these are not the only factors. If we think of our economy as akin to Clooney's boat, money is the fuel coursing through its veins. If humanity has developed god-like powers, those powers are combined with the more mundane engineering problems of inexperience in understanding our boat and the human problems of a bickering crew. It's like we have a boat with a hugely powerful engine, but a crew with little competence in sailing it. We are in the terrifying position of being masters of our own environment, whilst we are not quite masters of ourselves. 

Some have said that it's easier to see the end of the planet than the end of capitalism. Money has always been recognised as dangerous to the human soul. For example, philosopher Plato describes the decline of a system of honour caused by a 'secret desire for treasure.'

In the song 'Don't Stop me now' by Queen, the lead vocalist, Freddie Mercury, sings that the world is 'turning inside out.' Ideas in the minds of human beings become embodied in physical form through economics and technology. We are in a world powered by money and ideas. Our civilisation's reigning set of ideas about money - the intersection of money and ideas, these two powerful forces that drive our economy - is called economics.

Economists study scarcity, amongst other things. Here we focus on three forms of scarcity. Space is limited, although it is more limited in some places - like Hong Kong - than others - like Siberia. Time is limited too. What I do with the hours of my day today is irreversible, and those hours are unrecoverable. And finally, natural resources like fossil energy are limited. Humans of our era have built a civilisation that is powered primarily by stored-up sunlight - coal, oil, and gas. But by releasing their combustion products into the atmosphere, our use of this stored-up sunlight threatens much greater storms in the future. One great issue that makes it very difficult to shift course from our current trajectory, even though it is pointed straight toward shipwreck and disaster, is sheer momentum. Our whole economic way of life is 'locked in' to a particular course and the message is 'don't stop me now.'

So if the world of ideas - in particular, economic ideas - now influences the very fate of our planet, how on earth did we get into this situation in the first place? To get a sense of this, let's first go back in time a couple of centuries to the era of Adam Smith and the ideas that first gained currency in his time. Then we'll run the clock forward, observing revolutions of politics, technology, and ideas.
