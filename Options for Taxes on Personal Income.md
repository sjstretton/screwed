# Options for Taxes on Personal Income

Income Tax and National Insurance together account for around half of all revenue raised. These taxes are likely to be important for the foreseeable future. Income tax is important as a tax on wage income and on income from investments.  It is also the primary means of affecting the distribution of income using the tax system. However the existing approach is, like the rest of the tax system, unnecessary complex. Income tax, and its close cousin National Insurance (which we combine into a single tax) are also extremely efficient ways of raising revenue.

At present, the wage income is largely deducted at source in the 'Pay as You Earn' (PAYE) system. This means that companies administer the payment of income tax. They know how much tax to deduct because every individual has a tax code. The tax code indicates whether the taxpayer pays basic or higher rate tax. 

Some income does not fall under PAYE for example: dividend income. It is impractical for a company to know all the tax codes of its shareholders. Thus, income from dividends needs to be declared by individuals at the end of the tax year alongside income tax paid by the individual concerned. At present, corporation tax is paid on profits, and the income tax paid on dividend income is reduced by an equivalent amount to compensate. 

## Simplification Options

We can distinguish between tax simplification and the addition of a basic income.

First, lets look at tax simplification. We can simplify the tax code through the following procedure. First put the income tax and NI system together for earned income, and apply the same rates to unearned income as earned income. Then, you would consider the top rates of tax (Income Tax + NI). We keep these as they are now, and then apply it to lower tax bands. At the same time increase the personal allowance. The two procedures can ensure that nobody pays more tax on their earned income than they do at present. 

- Option 1 is this zero-high rate system (ie a large personal allowance plus a top rate)
- Option 2 is the same system, but with a low rate (no personal allowance) plus a high rate. A small basic income can be added.
- Option 3 is a basic income plus the high rate flat tax

With a flat system, everyone faces the same tax rate. There is no need for a separate tax code for each individual. All income can thus be taxed at source. This would also brings the taxation of dividends into the income tax system, which would therefore mean there is no need for a corporation tax on the part of company profits hich is paid out as dividends. We still, however, need a tax on retained earnings.

The disadvantage of a flat tax system is that it is less progressive than the other system.

## Conclusions

We propose to combine the current National Insurance and Income Tax systems so that there is a single tax on income. We also propose to simplify the rate structure so that there is only one rate above the allowance. Having a single rate allows the tax system to be made considerably simpler, and permits taxes to be deducted at source.

# 13.7 Overview of Possibilities for Taxing Wealth 

## Source-based Private Wealth Taxes

In general, we prefer to recommend source-based wealth taxes rather than residence based taxes. In other words, we propose to tax income-generating assets located in the UK. The advantage of this approach is that these assets are typically less mobile than the individual. This reduces the risk of tax avoidance. However, there may be a case for an internationally coordinated residence tax as well. 

## Residence-based Private Wealth Taxes

Because of the source-based wealth taxes we have suggested above, such a tax would not need to be set as stringently. However, risk of avoidance by the rich may be high because of their access to skilled legal advice and mechanisms to move their assets to the most advantageous locations. It may therefore be necessary to impose an international residence-based wealth tax.

We propose to consult with European and other partners so as to put in place an internationally coordinated wealth tax. The objective would be to ensure that the richest in society do not get richer faster. As outlined in previous chapters, the increased rate of growth in wealth as compared to the growth in average incomes contributes to the compounding of inequality. For a variety of reasons, this is not a desirable outcome. To that end, we aim to form a coalition with other countries to promote transparency, and create a single coordinated residence wealth tax. However, getting international agreement consensus on such a policy would be difficult and time consuming, and so should not be relied upon.

## Conclusions

We will apply a source based approach which minimises the possibilities for avoidance, including a land value tax
