# 14-B Frequently Asked Questions

Throughout this book, we've tried to outline how powerful changes to the tax and welfare system in the UK could be. Issues of inequality, personal well-being and environmental change can all be addressed through the clever application of taxation policy.

However, we've outlined some common questions below that we have attempted to answer, drawing together the threads of this book into one, easy to follow format. 

## Q. Why is it bad that the current tax system is complex?

A. Complexity adds costs and makes it more likely that there are loopholes that can be exploited unfairly by those who have (or who can pay for) specialist knowledge. A certain amount of complexity is unavoidable if one wishes to tax a complex economy with various shades or different types of activity that are not easily or definitively categorized. However, the complexity of the modern economy complexity of the UK tax system is somewhat overwhelming and betrays the influence of meddling politicians and vested interests.

## Q. If we seek to unilaterally reduce tax avoidance and evasion, how do we know that companies won't simply take their business elsewhere, to more advantageous tax jurisdictions?

A.This question assumes that a tax system would have incentives to leave unless we allow companies to avoid or evade tax. However, the corporate tax system that we propose is designed specifically such that the incentives are for companies to stay, not to go. 

## Q. How do you intend to make your proposals politically feasible?

A.Different people are likely to be motivated in different ways. Some people want to pay less tax. Our proposals will be assessed against the whole population and to see that a majority of the people will pay less tax. Others are motivated by fairness concerns. Still others may have more complex view based on various notions of common sense and/or are simple arguments presented in a compelling way. We will package our reforms in a way that can be expressed as a change from the status quo and in a way that appeals in a majority of people. We will also speak to individuals to see their opinion in tax and welfare and to ensure that the system aligns with these opinions.

## Q. How much and in which ways does Brexit alter the playing field for tax and welfare reform, versus being an EU member state?

A.It depends on what happens next. If the UK joins the European Economic area outside of the EU like Norway, so the UK would be subject to most of the same laws as inside the EU. In particular, we would be required to have a value added tax (VAT). As a member of the EU Customs Union like Turkey, some laws and regulations would still apply. (Clarify this) Even outside the European project entirely, it is likely that the UK would be subject to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and in particular the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

## Q. Wealth inequality is increasing, but UK income inequality allegedly hasn't changed since 1990. What is the relative importance of these two metrics to quality of life, and do we need to worry given that income inequality appears to be stable?

A. International comparisons tell the opposite story. Whilst the UK has one of the most extreme levels of income inequality in Europe, whereas our wealth inequality (which is generally more extreme) is in relative terms moderate. Adding in housing costs and the picture is even more difficult in income terms. Saved income (plus investment returns) is the rate of change of wealth.

## Q. Why is a land-value tax preferable to a Hong-Kong system of land-lease sales?

A. The land is no longer owned by the government anyway. It would need to be bought back at expense. We do propose that the government does something similar to the HK system, by replacing mortgages by land-value-tax indexed purchase and lease back.

## Q. Re: tax revenues, shouldn't we aim to raise ?650billion or more, given the deficit? (Ben Dyson)

A. Good point.

## Q. Many renewable sources of energy are capital intensive. Does a debt tax hurt their ability to raise money? (John McCone)

Whether a debt tax should be simple (liek the current bank balance sheet) or only cover unproductive investments is a question I'm still debating.

## Q. Why are you obsessed with exports? CI is a wage subsidy that will reduce the cost of British goods, which could be a virtuous cycle allowing people to live off lower income. Exempting exports from 40% tax means domestic companies will charge perhaps 20% more to British people than foreigners, while taxpayers subsidise the wages of factory workers. (John McCone)

A. I'm obsessed with exports because the UK only manages it's current dire current account positoon (it would otherwise be worse) by arms sales and financial dealings. Also export-industries tend to produce hgih quality jobs and a balanced trade account would mean we are not constantly selling assets to foreigners.

## Q. Is a citizen charge a poll tax? (John McCone)

A. Not sure what does this refer to?

## Q. Isn't your policy to boost exports fundamentally incompatible with your policy to reduce CO2 emissions?

It may make more sense to import from abroad if UK citizens must both pay more for domestic products than foreigners and absorb the cost of the carbon tax. (John)

A. No. With incentives in the tax system multiple objectives can be acheived

## Q. Is there real value in redistribution? (John)

There's a utilitarian benefit, in that poorer people get more utility from a margina pound and a macroeconomic benefit (surplus recycling).

## Q. Re: a tax on cash, isn't the amount of evasion via cash-in-hand payment negligible compared to corporate loopholes etc? (Ben)

No. Cash-in-hand is likely to be a very significant part of evasion. It's an inherently hard thing to measure, but some of the studies suggest it's very significant.

## Q. Would a retained earnings tax not fall foul of GATT? (Ben)

Retained earnings tax per se wouldn't necessarily fall foul of GATT/WTO rules. But our proposals might. We want to make things as simple as possible for exposition and then for WTO reasons fit in with their proposals.

## Q. The super-rich don't hold their assets in the form of low-interest bank deposits, so would a bank deposit 'wealth tax' not be quite regressive? (Ben)

I agree. I'm adopting this comment and making sure our proposals are progressive, probably though a tax-free allowance for registered individuals.

## Q. Isn't it really a negative income tax that you are proposing?

You plan to offset payment of Citizen's Dividend against taxes that are highly visible such as property taxes so that individuals will receive or pay only the net amount of either taxes or benefits.  If you're only paying net amounts, then you need to know what the individual's income is. That means you're having to assess income again to decide how much CI to pay to people. This means it's not a CI. One of the main advantages of a CI is that you pay it to everyone regardless of income, with minimal administration costs, then adjust the income tax schedule to get it back from the higher earners. Why are you adding this administrational complexity back into the system? (Ben)

A. I don't think we need to add in administrative complexity. I would just make the payment of Citizen's dividend and non-PAYE taxes such as council tax on the same day at the same time.

## **Q; How will we ensure that a citizen’s dividend is affordable and doesn’t disincentivise work?** 

**By making the UK an attractive place to live and do business, the incentive for capital flight is reduced. High-quality infrastructure, regional development and a highly skilled workforce are all elements of this strategy.**

**A. This question assumes that a tax system would have incentives to leave unless we allow companies to avoid or evade tax. However, the corporate tax system that we propose is designed specifically such that the incentives are for companies to stay, not to go.**
